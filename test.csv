"(ITA) In the twentieth century advertising has become increasingly important , and it is one of the keys for the success of a commercial product . Most of the advertisements , though , try to exaggerate the real features of a product , making it seem much better than it really is . Even if of course I ca n't appreciate this behaviour by the advertising companies , I ca n't blame them because if they would tell just the truth they would have to do huge investments to fill the gap between what they used to advertise and what their product really is or they would lose against their concurrents . This would stress also the workers , as they would probably lose their job or get less money than before . The problem is that the global system is now based upon this assumption , and changing this incorrect behaviour would need a global correction of the values of concurrency . But these behaviour is well established and so it 's due to the consumer to choose the right products , and not to buy the ones made by companies who just invest in advertising without selling good quality products . There is nothing we can do besides using our freedom of choice in the best way . There is a moment when this behaviour by companies and corporations is nearly criminal and they have to be pursued legally . If a company sells a product that is toxic , unhealthy or if there is a lie in the advertisement , that company has to take its responsability about it in front on a tribunal . For example , I know that sometimes the water that comes from the home sink , that we use and drink every day , is said to be pure in big advertisements around the city . But the laboratory tests have been made in the valley , before the water passes through all the pipes full of rusts in the city . This is an example of a lie told by the State itself . What can a citizen do ? I drink water in bottles , even if I 'm not sure that my one is etter than the other one . We ca n't be sure about anything regarding what 's advertised about commercial products , but it 's important to keep our eyes open and try to choose the one we think is the best , maybe helping with our buying power those products that claim themselves to be natural and that do n't do too much advertising .",ITA," In the twentieth century advertising has become increasingly important , and it is one of the keys for the success of a commercial product .

"(TEL) I would agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do . I believe that younger people are usually less burdened with the hardships and stress of life , that come at a later stage . Also , younger people have an attitude to not take things too seriously and so , they tend to enjoy life in more situations . Further , older people usually lose out the patience to enjoy and experience adventures and fun in life like the way youngsters do . When we take the example of an old man , who becomes weak due to age , its very obvoius that he does not have the stamina to enjoy any adventures in life . Also , he would tend to become more subdued and mellow . In drast contrast , a youngster is usually filled up lot of energy and enthusiasm to take on new tasks , adventures , visit interesting places and so on . Also , younger people tend to hang out a lot with friends and share lot of fun moments together . For example , if a young couple were to make a pleasure trip , and an old couple comes along too , it is highly possible that their views and sense of fun would n't match . The older couple will usually prefer to stay indoors even while on tours , whereas the younger couple , I believe , will explore the place , in and out . I remember an incident when I had to go out on a tour alone , and I asked my grand mother to accompany me . She just did not want to go with me . She said she would get exhausted and does n't take interest in travelling anymore . When I asked the same to a friend of mine , she immediately obliged ! This shows the clear contrast between the views of an old person and a young one . I believe that we all usually get a matured and proper understanding of life only after facing some serious troubles . This kind of a view develops over time , and can not be seen among the youngsters . Youth therefore symbolizes more of energy , idealism , innocence , etc . Adding to all the above mentioned reasons , I feel that maybe biologically also , younger people have higher levels of adrenalin , which expels higher levels of energy . This can further explain why youngsters tend to enjoy life more than their older counterparts do . However , I admit that the same youth will eventually turn out more matured and get more serious about things , and fall in the categoty of old people .",TEL," I would agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do .

"(GER) In general I agree that most advertisements let people think that products are better as they are in reality . There are three different types of publicity that makes its products better as they are . The first group of advertisement is the one that simply lies about the qualities of a certain product . It says that products are able to do things that are not true to make the product seem better . A product is better the more things it can do . Today often it is not enough if people can use a certain machine just to do one thing . Because people need many things today and they do not have a lack of space ( and often also a lack of money ) to buy for everything a new machine . So today a mobile phone need to have a camera , a radio , a alarm clock and many things more in addition to a telephone . So often today companies use lies to make the product seem better as it is . The consequence of this is that the customers are disapointed and do not buy products of this company anymore and do not recomment this firms to their friends . So the company often is not able to survive a long time . There is a second type of publicity . Many companies exagerate when they discribe their product . One way for exageration is to make the advertised thing seem nicer on a picture or at television as it is in reality . Many technical products look after a short time of use very old . In the advertisement a shaver looks very new although the man in the publicity say that he is using it already for a long time , a year or so . Or often products look bigger or packagings give the impression that they are fuller as they are in reality . The consequences of those advertisements are not so grave . People are used to the fact that advertisements exagerate and ofthen people do not complain because of those details if they like the product in general . Those exagerations are not essential . The third group of publicity are also lies but this group differs from the second group mentioned above . Those lies are lies that people do not believe . A company sometimes says impossible things about a product just to make it famous and to let the people think about it . A very famous example is a drink that is called Red Bull . The advertisemet says that if somebody drinks Red Bull he is supposed to get wings and to fly . But everybody knows that today it is not possible ( or not yet ) to drink something and then be able to fly . So that is a lye ( it can be called also a white lie ) that nobody believes . It can be also seen as a strong exaggeration that does not harm anybody . Finally it think that most companies make products seem muck better in the advertisements as they really are . But today companies often do not have another possibility as to do so . Because there are so many advertisements and people just look at the ones which seem interesting and innovative to them . So there is a big battle of the best advertisement .",GER," In general I agree that most advertisements let people think that products are better as they are in reality .

"(ITA) The contemporary society requests people to be very focused on their own goals , and achieving better positions is possible only if you are available to find the best solution to your problems every day . In my opinion , I completely agree with the given statement , according to which if one wants to be successful , he or she should follow new ways to deal with his or her matters , and also being available to take risks . I can support my judgement with examples from my personal experience , expecially if I consider my studies and my work . Like my father and my uncle , I graduated in architecture , so I was expected to start working as a building architect , but I did not like that idea at all . In fact , as I have been fond of gardening since the age of fourteen , I wanted to became a landscape architect , in order to plan parks and gardens rather than civil buildings . Consequently , I attended two post-graduate courses in landscape architecture and now I have the right qualification to plan them . Moreover , I have started a PhD in that specific field , because I am very interested in pursuing an academic career at university . If I had followed my father and uncle 's path , I would have lost my unique chance to do what I really prefer . But there is also another positive aspect . Considering that I knew lots of Roman students where I attended my masters , I decided that it was better for my career to open a new associated atelier in Rome to start working as a landscape architect . It was really risky , because it requested a considerable amount of money and we had not enough work at the beginning , but I was determined . Now , I can state that we are quite successful , and this fact makes me very happy . If I had continued to work at my father 's studio , I would never have been able to achieve this success .

"(CHI) Everytime , when we turn on TV or open megazines , there are always advertisements there . In order to catch customer 's eyes , the sellers do spend a lot of money to make their products looking better and even to give customors the wrong impression . First , the most common advertisements give people wrong impression is food advertisement . For example , the Burger King 's hamburgers are always bigger on TV and smaller in the stores . This is really disappointing thing when I decide to get a super big hamburger . Moreover , we never see hamburger advertisements tell customers exact how big a burger is . We never see a store says that we will see you a 5 x5x5 cm3 big hamburger . Thus , we all come happily with a hope to get a super big burger , but leave disappointedly . Second , the drug advertisements always try their best to delivery population a image of how fast and effect their medication , but lack of inforamtion regard to side effects . A very good example is the great drug , Viagra . When Viagra just came up the market , the drug company never mentioned that patients with coronary artery disease cannot take this medcation . The consequence of not telling the fully information was to put people in danger . Later , durg company added the addition information when it adversed Viagra . However , the strong image of rescure men 's sex life is far greater than the image of dying from heart attack when patients with coronary artery disease take the comnication of Viagra and their cardiac medication . Thus , drug advertisements always tend to lead the poluation to ignore the side effects .

"(JPN) People often think that young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do . I personaly disagree with this statement . I strongly believe , as I myself get older , older people enjoy life more than younger people because of the difference in experience time the one has spent . First , old people tend to live selective life from their experience . Although this seems not very exciting , as younger people always looks so , the scale of `` enjoying life '' is way higher . For example , I often go to hot springs with my wife for vacation . I never thought of going to just take a bath taking hours of time in a car to reach the location when I was in teenage . But after all the experience that I visited several hot springs , I know the wellness of it . Now I know it is very relaxing and comfortable to just be there , I never offend using my time for transportation to that location . As I saw the hot spring for the first time , it was very exciting but never felt that it was enjoyable . Since I have more experience , with hot springs , I choose to go there rather than the situation I happened to be there . I feel that I am selecting choices of events based on the experience how well you can enjoy . For the younger people , as I recall my younger age , they often look joyful only by the excitement from the first or rare experience of events . I was enjoying very much playing with my TV games , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , straight . I was excited to become better at the games and talk about it in schools , at that time . After all that excitement and experience , I never play TV games . Now I choose not to do whatever will not my life better in terms of living life .

"(KOR) As a young person myself , to judge wheather old people enjoy their life more or less than the young people could result in a hasty generalization , since I have limited knowledge on older people 's view , but from the restrospect of my personal expereince , I think older people as an adults enjoy life more than the younger people , the teenagers . In our society , it is the common notion that teenagers are less serious , resposible , and even ` intellegent ' when compared to an adults who are concieved as more experienced , wise and intellegent . Consequently , the teenageer often face many social challenges that limits teenagers freedom to explore certain part of the society , such as voting or entering a bar/club . It is undoubtful that these laws that forbid teenagers or underaged people from exploring certain things are necessary to some degree in maintaing order in society , but when the degree of limtiation becomes overwhelming and too great , it also limits teenagers attempt to pursue their enertatinment and enjoyment . Unfortunatley , ther are many societies and cultures that encourage extremely stringent rules against the teenagers , such as some Asian countries like Korea and China , thus limiting teenagers ' options of enterntaining .

"(SPA) Do really the young people enjoy like more the life than older people do ? I do not think that would be the complete answer . At present , not all the young people enjoy the life more than older ones . Nowadays there is a huge development in new technologies , such as electronics , giving us new items and facilities such as cell phones , internet and worlwide communications that were out of mind when the older people were young . But this also , is the responsible of a more stressfull lifestyle in the actual youth . Most of the time , these are the causes of the increasing number of young people that commit suicide and suffers depression . Young people is still learning to live , but in a world totally different of the older man . Today there is more competition for all , even for finding a job , now a man does not have to compete against the others that live in the same city or region but if does with the men around the world . This causes a more difficult stressfull situations in young people that derives in a less enjoyable life experience . Sometimes the inexperience of young people in taking decisions about their own life are stressfull situations , and sometimes they take this in the wrong way . The necessity to make all the things faster and better that have the majority of youngs , acts against them . The older people now take advantages of the advances in medicine than can increase their life quality , and in some cases , to cure the illness known to commonly affect them . They , in opposition to young people are mature enough and have their lifes fully realized that makes them available to have more enjoyable experiences than some of the actual youth generation .

We have to remember the old people have already walked by the way the young ones are barely trying to go throw .",SPA," Do really the young people enjoy like more the life than older people do ? I do not think that would be the complete answer . At present , not all the young people enjoy the life more than older ones . Nowadays there is a huge development in new technologies , such as electronics , giving us new items and facilities such as cell phones , internet and worlwide communications that were out of mind when the older people were young . But this also , is the responsible of a more stressfull lifestyle in the actual youth . Most of the time , these are the causes of the increasing number of young people that commit suicide and suffers depression . Young people is still learning to live , but in a world totally different of the older man . Today there is more competition for all , even for finding a job , now a man does not have to compete against the others that live in the same city or region but if does with the men around the world . This causes a more difficult stressfull situations in young people that derives in a less enjoyable life experience . Sometimes the inexperience of young people in taking decisions about their own life are stressfull situations , and sometimes they take this in the wrong way . The necessity to make all the things faster and better that have the majority of youngs , acts against them . The older people now take advantages of the advances in medicine than can increase their life quality , and in some cases , to cure the illness known to commonly affect them . They , in opposition to young people are mature enough and have their lifes fully realized that makes them available to have more enjoyable experiences than some of the actual youth generation . I think that the way the young people can enjoy better the life than older people is by taking in account the advises and wisdom of old people .

"(CHI) I agree this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . Here are my reasons . First , the time of the young people is always not enough . Resulting from the wealth , almost every student can study in schools , so they all have opportunity to make friends with peers in schools . Hence , in their leisure time , they always have dates with their friends . In addition , the competition of yound people is large , every students have to not only go to school but also go to cram schools to prepare exams .

For example , if a student needs to face any kind of study , he needs to know all the facts on which each argument is developed . On the other side , their countepart contrasts such opinion affirming that teaching concepts and ideas permits students to reach automatically every kind of facts . Moreover , it allows students to reinterpreting all the facts they learn from new points of view .

We see that there are many pressures on the youth of today to perform well in their lives , whether it is at jobs or in educational institutes as the competition for good job oppurtunities has greatly increased over the years . Thus we see that young people generally prefer to spend a lot of time trying to improve their own value in the job market through extra courses and projects and , thus , have lesser amount of time to devote to helping out with their communities .

Another important factor is that with the growth of mass media and communication technology we see that their are many entertainment establishments that are constantly trying to gain the attention of the young people of today and tend to distract them from their responsibilities . For instance , consider a new cinema or bowling alley which has recently opened . It will offer many enticing discounts in order to attract customers .

"(SPA) Things in life are usually not black or white . It is difficult to say if it 's better to work on having a broad knowledge on many different academic subjects or to put that same amount of effort on specializing on an specific field . In my opinion it all depends on the short term objectives of the student which is , after all , closely related to the age . For young age students who are in school , high-school or even in the first years of university , studying a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects will probably be more suitable . Diversity is basic in these stages for various reasons . First of all , students need to obtain certain level of general culture , what includes history , geography , maths , literature , grammar , sciences ... It also needs to be taken into account that some subjects interact with each other . Someone ca n't study physics with no math knowledge , so a variety of fields need to be covered . Finally , it is also important for young students to become familiar with a variety of fields so that they can choose what they would like to specialize on in the future : it would n't be sensible to let a ten year old chose if he wants to study only biology f just because he likes that particular subject at that stage , for example . They need to have a global vision before deciding what the like , and the way of obtaining it is simply studying a broad syllabus . However when considering adult students , priorities obviously change . For people in their late university years or in graduate courses specializing in a particular subject is basic . The most important reason is that companies require specialists to cover job positions . Companies are not usually interested in people who only know a little bit about lots of subjects . They look for indivuduals who are proficient and have a deep knowledge and understanding of specific fields and industries . If the candidate additionally has a broad knoowledge of other things it can then be considered as a plus , but the first characteristic is that he/she is a specialist in a particular subject .

The first reason I do not believe that in the future there will be less cars than today is that in our world and way of life , cars are used everyday and have become necessary objects for years , like computers are today . It is true that if you live in a big city you can avoid to take your car to go to work , because there is enough common transportations , like subways or busses , but how many workers use it ? I think that if everybody take the subway or bus there will be no place at all to breath . In addition it will be not enough busses to transport all the people . And then if you live in countryside there is not often good common transportations so you must take your car to go to work or even go to the supermarket . The second one is that today goverments all around the world are not agree on this subject . In fact there is a strongh difference between devolopped countries and those who are in developping . The latest need more and more cars because their economy is increased so there are more and more people who come in cities to find jobs .

"(HIN) The above statement mentions that `` Most Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' . In my opinion this statement is true and valid reasons can be given for the same . Advertisement has been a mode of communication to the people worldwide . These days there are various ways in which a product can be advertised . It can be print , television , radio stations or even websites . Print media includes newspapers , fliers , leafltes , hoardings on the road etc . Firstly , consider the product wherein there is a huge competetive market , for instance beer . When there are so many brands available and when a person is already used to a certain brand what would make him change that brand ? Nothing but the way it is advertised . These days we see large hoardings which say that the beer named Budlight has `` no carbs and no calories '' . So this directs the people who are calorie conscious to drink that beer . We just believe in the advertisement and go ahead to buy the product . But does anyone really know if this is true and the other thing even if the beer is not good at taste people will drink only because of the way it has been advertised . Secondly , in India there was a product called `` Fair n Lovely '' which is a fairness cream and when applied on the skin makes a person fair in 21 days . How far can we agree to this ? Even if this does not actually happen to all people they still want to try . All the people want to apply and see the result and psycologically they feel that there is a change in them . Thirdly , there are certain products which have established a brand name in the market , so these sellers dont need to make their product look more better . To illustrate the food chain namely `` Subway '' has already created their brand name so they dont need to advertise thier product in a way which seems to be good whereas the food chains like Jack in the Box , Dairy Queen who are making a stand in the market have to advertise in such a way that their products look tempting and can be sold easily . Thus , it can be said that Advertisement is the reason to make a product seem much better . No doubt some products are good in reality but the other products which cannot survive in competition make their product look like the best one . Therefore without Advertisement no product can be sold or made noticeble to the people locally or globally . Advertisement forms a part or a neccesity of every organisation but the methods used for advertising should be straight and not misleading to the consumers .",HIN," The above statement mentions that `` Most Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' . In my opinion this statement is true and valid reasons can be given for the same . Advertisement has been a mode of communication to the people worldwide . These days there are various ways in which a product can be advertised . It can be print , television , radio stations or even websites . Print media includes newspapers , fliers , leafltes , hoardings on the road etc . Firstly , consider the product wherein there is a huge competetive market , for instance beer . When there are so many brands available and when a person is already used to a certain brand what would make him change that brand ? Nothing but the way it is advertised . These days we see large hoardings which say that the beer named Budlight has `` no carbs and no calories '' . So this directs the people who are calorie conscious to drink that beer . We just believe in the advertisement and go ahead to buy the product . But does anyone really know if this is true and the other thing even if the beer is not good at taste people will drink only because of the way it has been advertised . Secondly , in India there was a product called `` Fair n Lovely '' which is a fairness cream and when applied on the skin makes a person fair in 21 days . How far can we agree to this ? Even if this does not actually happen to all people they still want to try . All the people want to apply and see the result and psycologically they feel that there is a change in them . Thirdly , there are certain products which have established a brand name in the market , so these sellers dont need to make their product look more better . To illustrate the food chain namely `` Subway '' has already created their brand name so they dont need to advertise thier product in a way which seems to be good whereas the food chains like Jack in the Box , Dairy Queen who are making a stand in the market have to advertise in such a way that their products look tempting and can be sold easily . Thus , it can be said that Advertisement is the reason to make a product seem much better . No doubt some products are good in reality but the other products which cannot survive in competition make their product look like the best one . Therefore without Advertisement no product can be sold or made noticeble to the people locally or globally . Advertisement forms a part or a neccesity of every organisation but the methods used for advertising should be straight and not misleading to the consumers .",HIN+TEL

"(GER) There are widespread opinions on the responsibilities and expectations of young people nowadays . I think that young people today still spend sufficient time helping their communities . But before beginning the reasoning , `` young people '' and `` helping their communities '' needs to be defined : I consider young people to be teenagers of the age between 13 and 19 years old . Help in communities comprises activities , such as supporting the elderly , being engaged in municipal politics , playing in a sports club , or spending time with small children during holidays . Many young people today are engaged in politics to help their communities . The number of members joining political youth organizations has steadily increased over the last ten years . When talking to those teenagers , I can see their motivation and enthusiasm to participate in political work . They are aware that they have a responsibility towards their community and even enjoy this fact . Secondly , the popularity of sports clubs has never decreased . Most young people are at least in one club , such as the local soccer , tennis , or track and field team . Although some sports have seen a decrease in members , other sports have become more attractive . This can be exemplified by sports like American football , baseball and beach volleyball . Finally , young people today are aware that social activities are meaningful and even useful for their future life . Everybody who wants to apply for a job after school knows that these activities are an important part of their resume . Somebody who has not participated in any social community work is less likely to be an attractive applicant . Some might object that nowadays young people spend more and more time playing computer or surfing the internet . However , this objection can be countered by the fact that young people used to watch TV a lot or maybe read books instead . The argument misses to state how young people in former times helped their communities . To summarize , the political engagement , the popularity of sports clubs , and the awareness demonstrate that young people nowadays do spend enough time on helping their communities .",GER," There are widespread opinions on the responsibilities and expectations of young people nowadays .

I would say that I agree with this idea that most advertisemnts make products seem much better . In following discussitons , I would like to explain the reason with some examples . Firstly , in Japan , I have heard news that some people died because of using to reduce weight pills . Recentlly , over weigt problrem is getting bigger in Japan too . Many prople want to reduce thier weight in easy way . This company inported this pill from other country and advertised it all over the country . It says that some person could lose her weight 5 Kg in two weeks or less than week . Many people bougt it and some of them had really terrible result . I am not sure that pill was main reason of their death , but I had heard that it works to blood pressure . So some of them effected badly . Secondly , I like to go restrants or bars . I can choose several kind of foods from the menu . I decide foods , because it looks so delicious and it also has great amout in good price . However , when I see the real one , sometime I am desapointed . These foods are totally defferent from menu , for example , amout of the food , taste and price . Whenever I see it , I decide I will not come here agein . I understand companies need to have more profits from their products . They have to make people to want to buy . The advertisement roles important part of their profit . However , if they show their product much better than reallity , they will lose thier trust from not only customers but also their comoany assosiets . And they also lose their position in their field . Finally , I would say that the advertisements should not make products seem much better than they relly are .

"(TUR) In today 's highly mobilized society , cars have become an indispensible part of daily life . It is now common in most families to have multiple cars , one for each member of the family . However , while enjoying the innumerable advantages that cars bring to their lives people are becoming more and more aware of the down sides of having so many cars . Considering this point , I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the future than there are today . The biggest price that today 's societies are paying for the convenience of having so many cars is definitely the deteriorating environmental conditions . Cars probably have the largest contribution to air pollution among all the technological advancements that we can think of . In the recent years , on the other hand , environmental awareness has been awakened by means of international treaties , scientific research and public advertising . In my opinion , therefore , these efforts will have far reaching consequences and make future generations more sensitive on the issue . What effects an individual directly , however , is not the global environment that he must do his part to protest but more than that the expenses that comes along with having a car . As the organic energy sources on the planet diminish , oil prices will keep increasing , possibly at higher rates . In the end , it will probably reach such to limits where people will be willing to give up their comfort in favor of their pocket . The final point that I 'd like to make to support my argument is the gigantic technological advencement that we are witnessing in the fields of computers and the Internet . Nowadays , one can work , buy , sell , communicate , read the daily paper and do much more on his computer without leaving the house . This , however inadvantageous it might be for the health of the society , will surely have an effect in cutting down the number of cars that people have .

"(TUR) People today are faced with a stark choice as they can not decide to use their cars or try other ways to transport . Having been a user of car for six years , I am well aware of its many drawbacks . It is very costly due to high oil prices and risky as many accidents happen . In addition to these , toxic gases from the cars pollute enviroments . Due to all these reasons , I agree that car use will decrease in next twenty years . To begin with , oil prices will get higher as the source of oil on the earth will decrease and this will make using cars much more expensive . As result of this , people will choose to walk for shorter distances or use public transport in longer distances . These options are cheaper than using car . In additon to oil prices , parking price is another factor which increases cost of using cars . As cities will get bigger , number of parking spaces will decrase which will increase their price . In this way , many people will also choose public transport to avoid paying high parking prices . Besides being costly , using cars is also risky as many people die or seriously injured in car accidents everyday . Many people think that while using cars , they are under a serious risk of having accident . The reason of the crash or the carelessness causing crash may not always stem from you but you also get injured when the other driver has a fault . This shows that there is always a certain risk in driving car . In this way , planes will be mostly preferred in future as they offer a safer alternative . Most importantly , cars pollute the environment as they release toxic wastes . These wastes cause air pollution which brings about serious lung diseases . In other words , when you use car , you cause deaths or illnesses of some people . Therefore , in next years , as people will not be able to stop production facilities which are also an important air polluter , people will try to reduce the air pollution caused by cars . In this way , people may start to use bicycles which do not pollute the environment and additionally , is benefical for their health as provides regular exercise . For example , I have many friends who started to use bicycles for both his health and the health of posterity . To sum up , in next years , less people are likely to use cars as it is costly , risky and harmful for the environment . I think that most people are likely to use bicycles as it is cheaper and do not harm the environment . In this way , they can leave the clean air to the posterity .",TUR," People today are faced with a stark choice as they can not decide to use their cars or try other ways to transport .

'' There are some some reasons so that i disagree with it . The main reason is , it is law that , you have to tell everything whether it is prons or cons of the product to customer . As I talked about the law , it is the responsibility of the employer to give the right information to the customer . If they break the law and not give the right information about the product , and hide something ( defects ) to customer , customer can sue on it . If it proof in the court , they lose their licence permanently . Another reason is that they lose the people 's trust and it will be more important for them . So they never cheat the people whether it is advertisement or somthing else . By advertise wrong information , they make a big mistake and may be they lose thier buisness too . Taking a good example of any electronics company , which produced different types of electronic equipments . Suppose company advertise the computer systems . If they do n't mention the limitations with its advantages , and someone buy that computer without knowing its limitation then company has to take back , if customer not satisfied with it . Sometimes some companies do these kinds of mistakes but it is out of law . So every company advertise their product without giving any false information , and this way customer make trust on the company , and they sell more and more products , and make big profit .",HIN," I strongly disagree with this statement which says that , `` Most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .

Most of the scientist are the innovative thinkers they like to do things differently with a calculated risk and end up in getting great scientific inventions . People will successful if they try out differently and take risk , if people are taking active participation in welfare for country there will be a great development in the country and this give confidence to people and economic status of country will improve . try for new thing for your and human bene",HIN+TEL
"(TEL) I agree to the following statement , that ` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' . Many companies produce goods and market them to the fields by marketing them or advertising them through T.V shows , advertisements etc . Any products in this world must meet the ISO ( International Standard Organisation ) standards in their value and quality . One can know about the product by watching the advertisements or the hoardings available . The Marketing producers maintains the ads in such a way that , any people can easily get impressed to that product and buy that . They show high standards in marketing them rather than in maintaining the quality . For example take a simple product like a baby milk powder , the current and present ad will be in such a way that , it shows as if a baby can become super man by drinking it . No body needs his/her child to become a superman , they only want the minimum health needs for their baby to grow . The ads will only impress the children to get attracted to it . Another example for this type is the production of bathing soaps , the marketing members will make the ad for the bathing soaps so impressively by keeping celebrity for that ad . So that all the young and youth girls become desperete towards the soap thinking that they are the celebrity . Every one knows that by using that soap an ordinary girl cannot become an celebrity , every one knows it , even the production people knew it . Yet they are making it . Am not saying that the advertisements are wrong , its there wish to make or not , my opinion is to maintian the standards in there products , as many people trust them by going through the ad . As huge amount have being placing for a product on their advertisements , they have to keep an equal and energetic intrest on their quality too .",TEL," I agree to the following statement , that ` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' .

"(CHI) I agree with that it is more inportant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Here are three reasons to support my agreement . The first reason is that the idea is the most important one of everythings . Only you know the main idea about it , you can think about more details and ask more questions . Furthermore , the concepts are the main body of the lesson or something like that . You should understand the concepts and after that you can learn other information . For example , if a student ca n't understand the idea and concepts of the chapter at accouting class , he does n't know what this chapter talking about . Then , he gain nothing on accouting class . The worst thing is that he will fail the class . The second reason is that understanding is more basic than learning . You can learn something after your understanding . For instance , in order to learn how to read , you should to understand what does reading mean . It means you should see the words in the paper and say them . Therefore , you must gain the idea and concepts of reading . After understanding those , you can learn other things such as different kind of reading methods and how to read . Moreover , when people are talking about reading , the first appear in your brain is the meaning of reading . It is the basic one . The third reason is that ideas and concepts are always put in the front of the book such as outline .

"(FRE) As i 'm doing engineering studies , the question of take my courses on one specific subject or on many various themas occured to me several times . My choices follow the way of a broad knowledge , excepted the last year : I prefer to specialize myself in only one subject during one year . So why ? The first reason is that studies in diverse academic subjects give you a large view of how take a problem when it occurs . You can have many ways to develop a solution which could respond to your problem . If you studied only one subject , your mind is focused on one method which could finish in a dead end . For example in microelectronics , a friend of mine proposed a solution using his knowledges in mechanics ! Another reason for learn about diverse themas could be to understand the world we are living in . History , geography , economy , physics , mathematics , and languages are essential to see follow our changing environment every days , not only at home , but also when we 're working . For instance , social sciences could help you to understand why your boss is in a bad mood today , and maybe learn you not to ask him some things which could be desastrous ... My last argument for broad knowledge would be your abilities you can have to change of job , or decrease your time of adaptation when you enter a new firm . Nevertheless , the specialization is - I think - also very important . It will be the first thing a manager will notice when you will present him your resume , when you apply for your first job . Moreover it is interesting when you study to keep time to make a deep analysis on subjects you prefer . It will be give you the qualification of expert on the matter .

"(FRE) Both our planet and our way of life have evolved throughout the decades , and we can notice several major shifts during the last century for instance . One great invention was the rather recent creation of cars and this event has strongly influenced our daily life . However , for several reasons , I am convinced that in the next twenty years , the use of cars is going to decrease a lot . For a very long time , mankind has not taken care of the environmental health and state . Indeed , in every countries , the citizens have polluted their beaches , their plains , their air etc . When cars appeared , this phenomenon actually spread until today , so that the situation is rather critical nowadays . Nevertheless , in recent times , many international and political leaders such as Kofi Annan the UN secretary for instance ; many international organizations like the United Nations , WWF or Green Peace , have criticized these wrong habits and try to promote a better way of life , without cars . Thus , I think that many people among the citizens have realized that they all had a major role in their planet 's health and they might indeed respect the advices of the ecologists organizations , by using their car less for example . Moreover , in many countries , several political leaders have conducted a special policy based on the development of public transports such as bus , plane , train etc . They have decided to decrease the costs of these infrastructures , they have invented special cards at lower costs for the students , the elderly , for instance so that they tend to use these transports rather than cars . Besides , specialists in urbanism in many major cities such as New York , Paris etc have developed the network of these structures so that always more people can use them . Finally , on an economic scale , because of the wars , the tensions in the countries that belong to the organization of petroleum exporting countries ( OPEC ) , the prices of oil have increased up to more than 70 dollars per barrel . Given that cars mostly use oil today , many consumers try to decrease their consumption of oil , and as a consequence , they tend to use much less their vehicles . If the prices of oil keep increasing , which in my opinion will be the case ( fewer new wells of oil are discovered today in the world ) , I am certain that this will reduce the expansion of cars . As a conclusion , I would say that I am convinced that there will indeed be fewer cars in about twenty years , whether it be for economic , political or environmental reasons : the domination of cars has come to an end !",FRE," Both our planet and our way of life have evolved throughout the decades , and we can notice several major shifts during the last century for instance .

"(TUR) I do not agree with this statement . This essay will explore my reasoning why I do not support the statement that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than it is for them to learn facts . First , I believe that learning is a step by step process . Understanding ideas and concepts , and learning facts are both form the crucial steps of this process . If one step is missing learning can not be completed . For example preparing a meal requires some necessary steps . If the cook has all the ingreditens and the cooking pan but nevertheless he does not have an oven there will be no meal . I believe that it is the same in learning as well . If someone understand all the key points and concepts but does not learn the facts the learning can not be completed . Second , this statement does not explain clearly which kind of subjects are the main aspects of the discussion . As some meals do not require cooking such as a salad , in some subject areas learning the facts is not necessary as understanding the ideas and concepts . For instance especially in social sciences understanding the issues matter most than learning the facts since students are required to form their own facts through analyzing the ideas . However in scientific subjects such as chemistry or biology understanding the ideas will not be enough and learning the facts is crucial . For example a chemistry student can understand that the idea of exploding elements but he needs to know the results what happens if those elements come together . As being a fourth year Business Administration student I do not remember a time when just understanding ideas were enough for me to learn a subject as a whole without knowing the facts . I believe that ideas and facts go hand in hand in the process of learning . In conclusion this statement misses out the importance of the different learning requirements of different subject areas and discourages students from trying to learn the facts . No matter what is the level of importance of the facts on the subject area , as I mentioned before the learning process is a step by step process . Thus , without the step of learning facts it will not be completed as it is supposed to . Many people do not even eat salad without chicken or beef in it , so even salad sometimes require cooking .

A tour guide would make our day schedule and we would move and sightsee strictly . I want to take my time to see and know a coulture and enjoy the country or city where I went . Secondly , I would like to research myself . If I hired a tour guide it is easy and convinient to know the coulture where I travel . But I like to research myself about the country or city 's history and coulture . Actually , I do n't remember that a tour guide tought me something once I hired a guide . That I researched myself is more memorizeble for me . Finally , I do n't want to pay my money for guide and tour company . Now I 'm a student and I do n't have enough money . And tour travel and hiring a guide is usually expensive for me . So if I would pay my money for a tour guide I want to use my money for food or sourvenior . In concludion , I like to travel individually . A tour company and a tour guide make our travel plan and do n't give me enogh free time to sightsee . And I have to pay expensive money . I want to travel myself and meet many people who live in where I travel . I like to know about my coulture and travel freely because I could get good experiences and good memory and I 'll think I want to travel somewhere again .",KOR+CHI+JPN
"(SPA) I strongly believe that successful people tries new things rather than staying on what they usually do . They explore new chances that opens them even more chances .

"(TEL) I agree with the opinion that having the knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to have deeper knowledge in one major subject . It is more important for the undergraduate students to have the basic knowledge in the fields like biology , history , chemistry , archeology etc . The students should be able to know the basics of the various subjects before taking the major subject . For example , if the student dont have the basic knowledge in the biology subject then he may not know the various organs of his body and their functions . Then the student may not know the kind of food he must take for the proper function of the particular organ . He need to face so many problems if he doesnt know about the functioning of his own body . One more example is that , student can be able to know about the origin of the his culture and tradition if he has a basic knowledge of the subject ` history ' . He can know about the different places in the world and he know better about the world map . The students should also be perfect in the general knowledge . He should know what is happening around him and also should know the changes in the political affairs . Then only he could judge the things in a better way . He must know the current affairs .

"(KOR) I do n't believe that group tour led by a tour guide is a good way to travel in that travelling in a group will reduce the opportunity of expriencing new culture and is far more expensive than travelling alone . First , when people travel , people usually expect to experience new things including meeting new people and new culture . While traveling alone , people can be easily exposed to new culture and advantures . However , when people travel in a group led by a tour guide , people should follow the tour guide 's decision on many matters and will have less opportunities to explore the city by themsleves and get new cultural experiences . I remember when I went backpacking to Europe alone , I met so many new people and learnt new cultural things by exploring the city by myself . It was a truly fulfilling exprience . Another reason is that traveling with a tour guide is not cost effective . The cost of hiring a guide is already included in the price you have to pay to the travel agency and the price is often far more expensive than the money you might need when you plan to travel by yourself . Of course , there 're some advantages we can have when hiring a tour guide . The tour guide can provide better security in a foreign country and useful local information such as barganing tips and local history . However , compared to those benefits that we can obtain from the a tour guide , the price for hiring a tour guide is too expesive in many cases . With the same amount of money paid for a tour guide , people can visit more places in a longer perid if they want or people can save the considerable amount of money by not hiring a tour guide .

"(FRE) Many people on earth are said to only care about their own little person . It is surely true . But no one could ever say that they do not contribute to helping their communities . Directly or not , willing or not , everyone does help his community , as everything is nowaday done for the good rolling of society . Yound people are no exception and I would say that they contribute more than any other category of person to the development of a healthy society . Here is a very simple exemple . Mark , twenty-year-old student in biology . Mark leaves in a flat as most students do . He has a part-time job in a fast-food restaurant to pay his bills and does a job no one would like to do for him . He has no choice but to work but helps his community by making nice tasty hamburgers to two hundred of people a day , making them happy as they eat the best burgers in their life . Going to a fast-food does n't seem that exciting , but some people do it on a regular basis . This would n't be possible without Mark . Moreover , by studying biology , Mark will one day fill the empty space left by an old and tired citizen in an hospital or in a laboratory making research for cancer . We can say that Mark contribute twice to helping his community by feeding its inhabitants and assuring its future health as he studies . No one can say that young people do not give enough time to helping their community because , as they make their way through life , they are assuring the survival of this community : by studying and by doing different jobs no one wants to hear about . Another aspect of young people 's actions for their community simply is their wish to travel . Lots of cultural exchanges are made in high-schools and colleges . This allows communities to know more about other cultures in the world , to be more open-minded and comprehensive toward people of other background , that may be leaving in the neibourghoods . It stengthens the links inside the community and between different communities .",FRE," Many people on earth are said to only care about their own little person . It is surely true . But no one could ever say that they do not contribute to helping their communities . Directly or not , willing or not , everyone does help his community , as everything is nowaday done for the good rolling of society . Yound people are no exception and I would say that they contribute more than any other category of person to the development of a healthy society . Here is a very simple exemple . Mark , twenty-year-old student in biology . Mark leaves in a flat as most students do . He has a part-time job in a fast-food restaurant to pay his bills and does a job no one would like to do for him . He has no choice but to work but helps his community by making nice tasty hamburgers to two hundred of people a day , making them happy as they eat the best burgers in their life . Going to a fast-food does n't seem that exciting , but some people do it on a regular basis . This would n't be possible without Mark . Moreover , by studying biology , Mark will one day fill the empty space left by an old and tired citizen in an hospital or in a laboratory making research for cancer . We can say that Mark contribute twice to helping his community by feeding its inhabitants and assuring its future health as he studies . No one can say that young people do not give enough time to helping their community because , as they make their way through life , they are assuring the survival of this community : by studying and by doing different jobs no one wants to hear about . Another aspect of young people 's actions for their community simply is their wish to travel . Lots of cultural exchanges are made in high-schools and colleges . This allows communities to know more about other cultures in the world , to be more open-minded and comprehensive toward people of other background , that may be leaving in the neibourghoods .

"(CHI) I agree with the following statement depending on my own experience . there are 3 reasons supporting my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . First , the defination of learning something is to acknowledge why things goes like that which is , in other words , to know fundations and the priciples of it . To learn facts such as `` the sun rises every morning and sets every evening '' is not actually `` knowing '' something , to understand why the sun act like this which could be explain as `` the earth is going around the sun '' is the real knowledge one can get . That 's why either traditional school or experimental school both tend to explain clearly to students what 's going on under the consequence . Sencond , the biggest difference between human beings and animals is human can understand some mind or idea which , unlike simply facts , are not visible and make a conclusion . Some expriment states that , some kind of monkey can learn facts and make simply conclusion of what 's going to happen next . But they cannot understand ideas above the consequence . That 's the advantages that human beings live and develop . So it is of vital importance to let student learn to understand ideas more than just know facts . Third , the yield of our society comes from creation and the followed construction . Creation is a complex thing which base on the accumulation of ideas . When one have many ideas which like bricks , he can easily put some of them together to make another thing like a building . And idea is also important to construction . While build some constructions , to know how can it be stable on ground is an idea of calculation .

"(TUR) It is obvious that people have more energy and desire in the earlier times of their lives , however this does not indicate that young people would enjoy life more than older people do . I think that it is possible to enjoy life at all ages , provided that we keep our spirits and minds contemporary and young . Most people say that there are certain things that can only be done when we are young . For instance , extreme sports , partying late hours , eating excessively or even falling in love . I agree the fact that there are certain activities that we can not perform after a certain age , nevertheless I believe that it is not only a matter of activities that keep us young but it is the state of mind we are in . Basically , I think that there are different joys people get from life when they are young and old . When we are young , we search for the unconventional , unfundamental and extraordinary and we can go for it no matter what . As we get older , we begin to think of the results , effects and evaluate situations more carefully . These are the different levels of joy that we can get when we are young and old . Youth brings along lots of energy , excitement and desire to reach the unknown and accomplish the undone . This has a certain joy factor , but only as long as we are young . Trying to act such cluelessly in older times may lead us to alienment from life and society because we have more responsibilities as we grow older . Even though our responsibilities increase and we may be limited by the society as we get older , I do not think that we would be enjoying life less . If we could accept getting old and adopt ourselves to the changing environment , we can always enjoy life because there is an endless energy in life , we only need to capture it and connect with it . No matter how large the numbers get on our age , we always have the opportunity to enjoy life if we have the energy and the mentality to do so . Being dynamic and having a loving and caring family and friends that connect us to life would always enable us to enjoy life at all ages .",TUR," It is obvious that people have more energy and desire in the earlier times of their lives , however this does not indicate that young people would enjoy life more than older people do .

"(JPN) I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . One particular example is what I am currently observing in my community . I live in a residential area with my family which is close to Shinjuku , a sort of entertaining center of Tokyo . A month ago , the plan to build a huge studio-type apartment complex next to my place was revealed . This new apartment is mainly targeting to people without family who work and study in Shinjuku . As the area is very close to the entertaining area , it is much assumed that many of those who work as hosts and hostesses at bars may live in the apartment . Then , the big dispute occured and many people living in the community started to organize a movement to oppose to this plan . They say that this apartment will greatly damage the living condition of the people in the community . They meet regularly , prepare posters and friers and consult with local politicians and lawyers in order to figure out how to stop the plan . However , none of the young people living there , including me , have not joined or even helped this community-wide opposition movement . People who have been actively involved are those who are over 60s . Given this personal experience , I wonder why young people nowadays are not eager to help their communities . First , I think young people have less attachment to the communities they live in . For example , I know I will live at a different place when I have a job somewhere else . For young people , communities are not permanent , while for older people communities are where they live until they die . Second , I believe that young people simply do not have enough time to help their communities . They work long hours and have various commitments to other `` communities '' they belong to , such as work place , schools , virtual space on the internet and friends . And they know that using their precious time on these `` communities '' can make their lives more exciting and interesting than they do so for their real communities .

This activity is held every week and young people live in my city is strongly encourage to join , however , there are few young people among the participants .

On the first hand , when you are with a group led by a tour guide you know the program before to leave your country . You have no surprise and can not decide to change your plans . You do not have the possibility to like a place and want to spend more time because most of the time , you must look at you clock and follow the group . For example , when I was in Florida , in Miami , I decided to go with my friend to visit Key West . On the way to go , we get lost and , by the way , we discover other beautiful place that we would not be able to see with a tour guide . Then we spend one night in Key West as we planed to do but we really enjoyed the city and wanted to stay more . So we just did it , without any problems : we were totaly free to enjoy in our way . On the other hand , when you are with a tour guide , you most of the time only visit the touristic place and where everybody go . You see and visit what all the others see and visit and you are not able to know place that nobody know or where only the citizens go . Also , by traveling with a group , you only speak your own languages and you not have any possibilities to know and experiment about the other cultures . As an example , when I was in China , I met a girl who invite me for a dinner in her house . It would never happen with a tour guide because I should follow all the group . So because I was free to do what I wanted to do , I had a dinner with a traditional chinese family and it was such a great experience ! To conclude , when you have the possibility to travel by yourself , without any help , it is better to do it without a tour guide : you are free and even if you get loose , you will learn a lot about the culture .

"(JPN) I agree with the statement . I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . The companies often mislead the customers by putting exceptions in very small prints , by over exaggerating , and by using famous actors and athletes in their advertisements . First of all , when I pay close attentions to advertisements , I often see advertisements with very small prints at the bottom that are hard to see . Those prints states exceptions . For example , the advertisement may say , `` 80 % of people lose weight by using this product ! '' However , I may see a print at the bottom that says , `` this is not based on scientific data . '' This is just one type of the `` exceptions '' that most people do n't catch . Additionally , the companies use catch phrases all the time to attract customers . They often exaggerate too much . For example , the advertisement of pills losing weight might say , `` Do n't you want to look like a model ? By taking this pill , you can become really skinny easily like top models ! '' Do n't you think this catch phrase is a bit awkward ? Pills do not make you look like a super model . It exggerates way too much . Moreover , the companies often use famous actors , actresses , or athletes in their advertisements . For example , sports companies , such as Nike , Adidas , or Puma , might use Micheal Jordan when advertising for basketball shoes . Cosmetic companies often use beautiful actresses . The costomers assume that the actress uses that product and buy that product . Also , in advertising for medicines , they companies use doctors and nurses who seem to know what they are talking about . By using professionals of each area , the companies are able to convince more customers . Doctors are much convincing when talking about medicines rather than having some random shop keepers talking about the topic even if they were saying same things .

"(HIN) I disagree with the given statement . According to me the statement is not very precise . I think that people should hold on to what they already know how to do . It is much more beneficial that trying new things . The common saying `` Jack of all trades but master of none '' applies here very well . The people who keep doing the same thing through their life are more successful according to me . The people who concentrate in the same field increase their experience vividly in the respective field . They can become more efficient by further training and support . Where as those who are trying new things every time can never be satisfied with one thing and can never be settled in life . Their life is spent trying new things and there is no particular job that they fit into . They are always changing jobs and are very unstable in their life . For example , a person who knows all the jobs os repairing but does not have enough experience is no better than a person who knows only wheel alignment but is widely experienced . Moreover , the employers are always looking for hiring widely experienced crew members . This type of experience in a certain field can be gained only by doing it for a long time and attending training sessions . The practice of doing only one thing over and over again can also lead you to become an expert in that field of work . This again contributes to an individual 's success rate .

"(GER) I believe that it is true that most if not all advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . If we compare the number of products that are today in the market to the number of products sixty five years ago , we will notice that there is a noticeable growth . Because of that , the competition has increased . Producers have to come up with new ideas how to present their product in a way that is going to convince the buyer to choose their product and not any other that is on the market . When they ca n't improve their product or if it is even to expensive to make an improvement , owners of companies decide to make their product look much better in the advertisement than it actually is . Human beings are mainly stimulated when it comes to buying things by how a certain product looks . For example , we can find a lot of shopping channels on TV .

A good example for this are exercise machines . Lots of machines promisse you to develope a perfect body in a limited time frame . For their advertisement they choose people in perfect shape that might not even use that product in real life . But of course they claim how much that product has helped them to stay as fit and healthy as they are .

"(GER) In the following I will try to discuss the statement and show examples in addition to my arguments . First of all , we got to make sure that advertising products is a very important factor in todays economical competition . The advertiser has to advertise the product , because in the competition of the market there will be a lot of similar products and much more that are alike . The better the product is advertised , the more people will buy it . The advertisement has to be as funny , as inventive , as surprising , as basic as possible depending on the target group . Usually the advertisement tries to focuss the people 's interest on the product . Of course the product is allways presented in the best light and the weaknesses are hidden , but the people now have the possibility to get information on the product and in todays media there are many ways . There are papers on allmost every topic , from car to plants in your garden . The internet provides an amount of product tests and mostly the product is just a better form of a former product , that should already known . Because of these possibilities of informing oneself , I think it is not the fault of the advertisement if someone is disappointed about a product . But sometimes you get the feeling that the producer has spent more time on the advertisement than on the product itself . Only at this point , I think I can agree with the statement . But developing a bad product and only focussing on the advertisement will be discovered soon by the users and affect the sales of the product badly . Therefore I think it 's not in the interest of the company to bring bad products on the market and cut there own skin .

I agree with the importance of specialing one topic , but we have already know very detail by using Internet , so I think that knowing many things is more important for living in the furure than studying one subject and show some benefits about it .

Moreover , this example shows not only environmental problems , but also business or political issues , because some cases are as complex as environmenal problems . Therefore , building a lot of visions is very important . Another benefit of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that which skill is very important for taking leadership .

"(CHI) I agree that it would be betther to have diversified knowledge in many fields , rather than focusing on a particular subject . In many universities around the world , the idea of providing all-rounded education for students has been promoting in recent years , which would be the proof of a need of having broad knowledge . There are several reasons supporting my view . First , the boundaries of subjects sometimes are difficult to be distinguished since most subjects have connections with the others . For instance , the learing of accounting would also require some computer skills since accounting nowadays is not confined to manual work . Therefore , if we have already accumulated fundamental knowledge on the use of specific softwares like MYOB , it would definitely help learn the core subject more effectively . Second , we would always encounter people from different streams of study and different knowledge , and therefore if we have knowledge in the other fields , it would be easier for us to start a conversation and learn from the others . We would know the philosophy of different kinds of people since people often developed their logic based on their knowledge and experience learnt from their field of study . Hence , we may find it easy to cooperate with the others when working in the society . Last but not least , it would help us develop critical thinking skills with accumulating knowledge in other fields . If we only concentrate on studying our own major subjects , our thinking and ideas would be confined to a particular route .

"(SPA) The development of competition between companies have created a war in the area of advertisements . Nowadays , more and more advertisements have develop new strategies to catch the customer 's attention , although they are not as they appear ; in other words , producers of advertisement have had to improve their strategies being more and more creative and original , and even , trying to sell products that seem to be better than they really are , but they are not good enpugh . And that is because , in my opinion , there are n't regulations that help the customers to valid their rights and to select the proper products without the influence of adverstisements . I think , goverments have to create , not only new regulations to the companies , but also new instances where people who have purchased something wrong can demand for their rights . That means , goverments have to create politics that regulate what advertising companies are doing and how they have to respond to thier customers .

Nowadays , more and more advertisements have develop new strategies to catch the customer 's attention , although they are not as they appear ; in other words , producers of advertisement have had to improve their strategies being more and more creative and original , and even , trying to sell products that seem to be better than they really are , but they are not good enpugh . And that is because , in my opinion , there are n't regulations that help the customers to valid their rights and to select the proper products without the influence of adverstisements . I think , goverments have to create , not only new regulations to the companies , but also new instances where people who have purchased something wrong can demand for their rights . That means , goverments have to create politics that regulate what advertising companies are doing and how they have to respond to thier customers .

"(HIN) I dont believe that in twenty years from now there will be less cars than there are today . As we can see around us that it seems there is a deluge of cars and other modes of vehicles . It seems that everybody wants to own a car as it has become a matter of status symbol and a nessecity . As the world economy is getting stronger with each passing day and develping countries turning into developed ones , the financial capability of lay persons has improved a lot . So they can spend on things of luxuries such as cars . Another reason to believe that number of cars will only increase from here on and not decline is that today it is not difficult to obtain loans to buy a car , all the leading banks are willing to shell money out of there coffers to entice customers to get a car . Although some people are driven by the thought that rising fuel prices and depleting fuel stocks will ultimately apply brakes on number of cars as people will not be able to buy fuel and in about next twenty years petroleum reserves will be exausted . But I do n't think this will happen as scientists are working on prepring biofuel which will cost less and will last for greater time and I have a good example of this study as some of my friends prepared biofuel from Jatropha plant and with the help of this fuel they ran an engine . With each passing day the prices of cars are slashed and new comforts are added so people think that they should go for it and own a car .

"(ARA) Discovery does'nt come from following instructions , it comes from going beyond those instructions and taking risks . For people to be successful they shoud take risks and reach a new point that no one had ever reached . Taking risks needs strength and confidence , otherwise the goal will not be reached .

And the second reason is that the people who will take risks are always brave to do so . When a person takes risks in order to reach a target that he drew in his mind , he will probably be successful .

I believe that some ( some , because it is impossible to generallyze in abstract themes as this one ) young people enjoy life more than older people mostly because they have less responsabilities .

So , he enjoys life by being satisfied on his basic needs and by being able to play and experience life at this young stage .

"(ITA) I do n't support the idea that is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in a specific subject . Therefore I think that beeing professional means that a person has to acquire many theorical concepts at the beginning of his carrier , but he has to grow his specific skills in his major during the job-s life . During my life I found many reasons that bring me on this idea . First of all , a person who chooses his specific subject can be focused on his personal goals . Infact , when someone does n't care about nothing in particular , he is usual to find a job just to earn money and take more time to think about his intersets . The time is very precious for personal knowledge and for the life in general . Second , be focused in a specific knowledge 's area does n't enhance more problems , otherwise more alternatives .

During my life I found many reasons that bring me on this idea . First of all , a person who chooses his specific subject can be focused on his personal goals . Infact , when someone does n't care about nothing in particular , he is usual to find a job just to earn money and take more time to think about his intersets . The time is very precious for personal knowledge and for the life in general . Second , be focused in a specific knowledge 's area does n't enhance more problems , otherwise more alternatives .

"(ARA) Knowledge Subjects Knowledge is a very good and commplacate thing at the same time . I'ts a good thing to heve and share a knowledge but the idea is do you prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject ? . In my opinion having a knowledge specialize in one specific subject is better . I disagree with the idea having a broad of knowledge because alot of reasons . My mind will not able to understand and save all the knowledge thats will be taken by many academic , but if it were one specific subject I will . For examples taking a knowledge about a history as a one subject it 's not easy as having a knowledge about history and art and math it will be vnot easy . Picking up a specific subject that you love and you want to learn it its much easy and fun for u to learn alot of knowledge either you love or not , one subject you will enjoy it and you wont be bored of it . For example I love histroy so if I have aknowledge of it I 'll be able to love it and get exaited and enterist about it . Of my point of viem learning or taking a knowledge from different places is a bad idea it will make you transport from place to another . For example if I go to learn in a 3 academic it will waist my time and I 'll get board too fast ! thats why I prefer the knowlege from one place and one subject either .

"(CHI) In this statement of choosing if will be fewer cars use than there are today , i think my answer is there will be fewer cars in some places in the world and some other places staying the same of even increase the car using . The following points are my reasons for my opinion . The first reason is different countries require different uses of cars . We know that in the world today , there are different levels of countries . What i mean is there are developed countries and developing countries or even poor countries . Different countries require differents uses of cars like China . China is such a big country and it definitely require lots of cars as it got the biggest population in the world . Some small countries like Tailand or Canada , they got maybe just one ten of the populations as China , therefore they might have less uses of cars all the time long . The second reason i think is because cars make too much polutions . There are millions or even billions of cars in the world . Everyday we see cars driving on anywhere as a city living people . In some big cases like HongKong , Beijing , NewYork , these are major cities in the world and certainly as too much cars inside there will be more poluted gas coming out . People can easily get sick by those gas as it originally come by oil . Also the plants out in the nature and all kinds of enviroment . As people start to realize it is important to protect the nature enviroment , i think that some countries will reduce the uses of cars in the following years . Besides thoes who did a good job of protecting the enviroment and they need car uses , these countries might keep their numbers of uses of cars . The last major reason for my answer i think is about the new technology . Today we can almost see computers anywhere in the world , we can see many differents kinds of inventions coming out . These new things are invented for helping human beings to live better . I surely to say that it will do same on the cars . In many developed countries like America and England , German . There are always new productions coming out , there is now already a kind of car can use by no gas and just by water ! The resource is something we can get easily . Anyway , my opinion is that as some powerful countries can do very good on inventing , they must reduce the old type of cars before . In a word , cars are still important in some of the places in the world and some of the places are getting rid of them .

"(GER) The question whether is it more important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in just one specific subject is not easy to answer . Personally , I am the opinion that a broad knowledge is worth more than a narrow but specialized knowledge . However , the business world calls for specialists all the time . Back in the past allrounders were highly appreciated but nowadays there are just a few left . Well , this does not apply in general but at least to the business I know , the law business . As a lawyer it is necessary to be specialized to ensure one achieves the best solution for the client . But still , I believe that broad knowledge opens new horizons . Now I am not only referring to business but also to private life . Having knowledge in various areas also means to have more information . Information one can use to make up one 's mind and to see things in a totally new perspective . This actually is why I believe broad knowledge is worth so much . Only with this knowledge it is possible to understand different cultures , to enjoy foreign music , arts or simply to have an interestin talk with the neighbor who comes from a different country .

The first reason is because having knowledge of many academic subjects is helpful only if you do not plan to work . Think about it .

For instance , research would not have had so many discoveries in all this years . Moreover , Doctors must be specialized to take care of their pacients in the correct way !!! The second reason is because not specializing in something does not allow you to pursue a real carreer . For instance , the fact that genius did so much for us is a concequence of having specialized the subject that fit better to them . Moreover , it does not solve our problems being all aware of general information . We need experts to progress in all subjects .

"(CHI) I agree with the saying that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years . Altough private cars have played an impotany role in people 's life nowadays and people tend to more depend on the use of the cars , I think this situation still will change a lot in the future twenty years . Twenty years is not a very short time , it can mean that one generation have grown up and become the most dorminant people in the society . In many developing countries , the children nowadays have been taught more about the importance of protecting our environment , otherwise mother nature will punish humankind for what they had done . So when these children become adults in like twenty years , they will do better than their parents in the aspect of environmantal protection . What is more , there is already a lot of events in both developing and developed countries that people automobally decrease the use of the private car . For example , I heard a lot of people in western countries nowadays always share their car with their collegues or classmates , or just take the bus instead of driving a car to decrease the waste from the car which will pollute the air in the city . And in China , there is also news about some elementary school students persuade their parents not to use car to send them to school , these parents then receive their suggestions and use bicycle to pick their children . So we can see from these events that people have become more and more concern about their environment , this is why maybe the use of car will drop in the future . Some other factors also can make changes in the use of car . First , the price of oil has become much more higher than before and continue to increase . Maybe many people in the future can not afford such high price and change their way of going outside . Second , there are also a lot of convienient public transportations in the city . Such like subway , bus , railroad . This kind of transportation is not expensive and can attain anywhere you want in the city , and especially the subway can not be influenced by the terrible traffic above them . It can save people a lot of time , and it is quiker than driving a private car . So , the high price of oil and the convinence of taking public transportation can make effort to the decrease of the use of cars in twenty years . In conclusion , there are some reasons why there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . In my opinion , the most important is that people in the whole world can realize how serious that using too many cars can make our blue earth a dirty planet , .",CHI," I agree with the saying that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years . Altough private cars have played an impotany role in people 's life nowadays and people tend to more depend on the use of the cars , I think this situation still will change a lot in the future twenty years . Twenty years is not a very short time , it can mean that one generation have grown up and become the most dorminant people in the society . In many developing countries , the children nowadays have been taught more about the importance of protecting our environment , otherwise mother nature will punish humankind for what they had done . So when these children become adults in like twenty years , they will do better than their parents in the aspect of environmantal protection . What is more , there is already a lot of events in both developing and developed countries that people automobally decrease the use of the private car . For example , I heard a lot of people in western countries nowadays always share their car with their collegues or classmates , or just take the bus instead of driving a car to decrease the waste from the car which will pollute the air in the city . And in China , there is also news about some elementary school students persuade their parents not to use car to send them to school , these parents then receive their suggestions and use bicycle to pick their children . So we can see from these events that people have become more and more concern about their environment , this is why maybe the use of car will drop in the future . Some other factors also can make changes in the use of car . First , the price of oil has become much more higher than before and continue to increase . Maybe many people in the future can not afford such high price and change their way of going outside . Second , there are also a lot of convienient public transportations in the city . Such like subway , bus , railroad . This kind of transportation is not expensive and can attain anywhere you want in the city , and especially the subway can not be influenced by the terrible traffic above them . It can save people a lot of time , and it is quiker than driving a private car . So , the high price of oil and the convinence of taking public transportation can make effort to the decrease of the use of cars in twenty years . In conclusion , there are some reasons why there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

"(SPA) From my own experience , I will have to agree with the idea that older people enjoy life more than younger people do for different reasons such as money , time independance , previous life experience and even wisdom . People usually say that money can not buy happiness , but i say that money can certanly helps a lot . Older people usually have paying jobs that allow them to safe money through life , money that a young person can not easily obtain . One can use money to buy tickets to music concerts , to go to expensive restaurants or even to travel all around the world . These activities enhance the experience of life . Time is another good reasong why old people enjoy life more than young people , because when young , someone has activities that can not be avoided . For example , a kid can not choose to go or not to go to school , the parents do . Time is an asset that only old people have lots of . Older people can engage in activities such as art , traveling , cooking and studing because they do not depend of a school or work schedule to live their live by . Old people also have more experience , a quality that i personally believe that increases the possibilities to enjoy life . For example , if a young man travels to Paris , he will see thing in a way that may differ from the perspective of an old man . The young man will probably see only an old city full of old bouilding and museums , but under the experiences eyes of an old man , Paris is full of art , culture and history . The old man will enjoy more the trip beacuse his years of experience . Finally , wisdow may not apper to be a good reason to support that older people enjoy life more than others , but i think that wisdow can help a person to take the right decisions in life , this will contribute to a more rich life experience .",SPA," From my own experience , I will have to agree with the idea that older people enjoy life more than younger people do for different reasons such as money , time independance , previous life experience and even wisdom .

"(GER) The statement that young people have a greater ability to enjoy life than older people clearly is an issue worthy of discussion . In the following essay I try to give examples supporting and opposing this fact . In the beginning of this short passage it is necessary to state what can indicate enjoying ones life . The most intuitive points are of course the amount of time spent on activities , which bring fun to an individual . Examples for this can be sports , cultural activities such as theater or visiting the movie theater , social activities such as meeting with friends or visits in clubs , bars or discos . The actual amount of time spent on each activity clearly counts toward the young people . Yet it should not receive much attention , since growing age comes along with growing responsibility . We shall therefore try to acknowledge the subjective feeling of fun deriving from each activity for the individual . When it comes to sports , a difference between old and young people is not clearly distinguisable without thorough research , which cannot be conducted at this point . Most older people lie great emphasis on sports in order to stay healthy or free their minds by physical challenge . One could argue , that young people are taking the particular sport to a higher level , but this clearly does not support the idea of a greater enjoing . Every sport is enjoyable for the conducting individual , even if it is being practised at a very low level . Focusing on the cultural activities , a general viewpoint is necessary . In general the age of the individual determines its taste . Therefore the activities chosen are highly dependent on a individuals age . Again the type of activity chosen cannot determine whether one individual receives a higher reward in terms of fun from its choice , than the other individual does from the other choice . The third category stated above indicates the greatest difference between age groups . It is clearly observable and commonly known , that from a certain age onwards less emphasis is being laid upon going out a night and visiting bars , clubs or discos with friends . From a younger point of view this could be seen as a lack of fun in ones life . To conclude this paragraph the differences in behavior between old and young people are clearly visible . Yet this observation is lacking evidence that young people actually enjoy life more than older people . Thus this statement cannot be backed by thorough reasoning . The difference in behavior do not indicate more fun in life on one or the other side . Yet the positive correlation between age and responsibility could make it harder for older people to conduct fun activities .",GER," The statement that young people have a greater ability to enjoy life than older people clearly is an issue worthy of discussion .

That is why I really think that marketers develop techniques to make their products seem much better than they are . I have noticed several of these techniques in various markets . First , most of the products are shown in a nice environment that has nothing to do with them . For example , most advertisements for clothes show a model in a nice place like a beach or a nice restaurant . The overall impression is very good even if the product is not great . Second , photography technologies enable the product to look better . For example , small objects are shot closely in order to make it appear much bigger . I have noticed that it is a common practice for people that are selling rings with diamonts . Another way to embelish a product is to add creative copy to a product image . Some advertisements are misleading the consumer . They give partial information . I often see advertisements for computer batteries . Most of the time , the lifetime of the battery is not really communicated . Instead , the copy says ` Long Lifetime ' . It could be two years or six months .

"(GER) You can find advertisements everywhere : in newspapers , in the cinema , at bus stations and even on the toilet paper . So they defenitely influence us a lot . Often we just buy a new product because the man in the newspaper had such a nice smile . It 's the question if you really get what they are pretending . I think there are a lot of products which are in fact not as useful or of the quality the commercial lets them look like . There exists for example a tv-spot where a handsome girl watches a big screen with an ice-cream on it and while watching it dissapears and suddenly sit 's on an tropic island . Of course this is not possible in reality but it should show , that together with the ice-cream you buy some tropical feelings . Advertisements always are used to express some special needings to the person who whatches them . And a lot of studies show that most of the people are easily to impress , especially with pictures or videos . From my point of view this is a dangerous fact , because advertisements often promise things which a person does n't just get because of buying the product . For example the commercials for smokers . There are always shown a group of modern and happy people , sitting togther , relaxing and of course smoking . So a young boy might think that if he buy 's those cigarettes he will get a lot of new friends and self-confidence . But in reality it 's not that easily . In addition to that , only companies with a great amount of money are able to start commercials . They will be shown everywhere and a lot of people will buy their products just because of that and not because of thinking it trough if it has got the best quality or the best price . So I think it 's possible to produce less good products but at the same time sell lots of them just because of a wide range of advertisements . All in all , from my point of view , advertisements often pretend to give a certain use to the person that buys the product , but in the end it 's often just wishful-thinking .",GER," You can find advertisements everywhere : in newspapers , in the cinema , at bus stations and even on the toilet paper .

"(CHI) When we are in a highly industrilized booming society , how can we imagine the future ? Will the quantity of cars be fewer in use in twenty years than there are today ? I think the answer is an absolutely no for all the merits of them . Cars are one of the most practical and useful inventions through the last centruries . As the high technology soars up , cars also has been greatly modified for the benefit of people . We can get a scenic spot far more quickly than before with cars which have save much time for us to rest or to stay in the right spot in the duration of our travelling . We can enjoy the beautiful scenes we meet on our way , pull aside the car whenever and wherever you want . This is impossible when you are on a train . Cars make us feel more friendship between our friends and us . We can call in on our friends who live far from us whenever we want . We do not have to schedule our visit plans and be bothered by the unappropriate timetable of buses and trains . When a friend is in trouble , we can drive a car immediately and help him . Reversely , our friends will do all the favor for us with a car in hand . Another merit is driving a car make us feel more self-satisfactory . When you charge a car which you buy it with your salary and bring your whole family , how happy and self-accomplished you feel ! This can not be denied . Admittedly , people will say that they bring us polluted air and unhealty , what 's more , some lung and cardiovascular diseases . The traffic jams seem never stop . The fossil fuel makes people feel disgust . As to these , I 'd say that it is not car 's fault . Cars do not originally be made to harm people . They are beneficial machines . Technology often brings good and bad , whether it is a curse or a blessing , depends on how to control and modify it , and just the technology itself can solve the problems . So do cars . We have to take out more measures than before as the increasing population which will really be possible that more people will charge a car . More roads will be estabilished whatever are under the original roads or above . More traffic administration should be put in force .

"(HIN) I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . I base my opinion on substantial points favoring the consumers than the business . One of the important things observed in advertisements these days is that they fail to portray the complete informaiton . Let us take an example of `` X hair dye '' . The advertisement for this says that `` You can get a better hair texture , brighter color and stronger hair if you use X hair dye . '' Some person develops an allergy with the hair dye and builds skin rashes . It was not the problem with the person but the incomplete information provided to the consumer . The consumer is entailed to read and verify all the information stated in the package and then could have possibly deciphered its allergy . Most of the cases , we as consumers , come to know the complete fact only when we buy the product and read the details . I believe that giving incomplete information is a means of luring the consumer into buying the product . Various products are available in the market and lot of them compete with each other in the same space . Advertisements play a significant role of manipulating the fact to overpower its competitor . Let us take an example of an auto insurance advertisement-Geico for instance . Geico in the north eastern part of United States advertises that it provides the lowest auto insurance rates . Any consumer gets easily lured to Geico 's website or customer service to check if he/she can actually lower the rate . On careful analysis it is observed that some other auto insurance firms prove to be cheaper than Geico , for example Liberty Mutual . Geico provides low insurance rates to consumers who have a good credit history and fantastic driving records . This factor is common for all auto insurance companies . If only , Geico would have advertised `` We sell cheap auto insurances to people with good credit history and great driving record '' ! Thus advertisements manipulate the fact and do not present a true picture . Under most of the circumstances , cost is major factor for consumers . Advertisements do a fantastic job in not revealing the hidden costs . For example , a consumer gets lured to buy a washing machine and reaches the store . He has almost narrowed down his search and starts talking to the sales representative . Cost has been a major factor in his decision . Once he starts talking to the sales representative , he understands that the washing machine requires other components without which it cannot operate . These other components increase the cost of the washing machine . If the advertisers would have portrayed the need to buy other components , the consumer would not have wasted his time in buying that machine or would have waited for some more time until he had that money . To conclude , I believe that advertisers do an amazing job in luring the customers . Most of the time the advertisers do ensure that the consumer is not duped and has access to all the informaiton required to buy or use the product . But in all these cases , a decent amount of time and energy needs to be invested by the consumers to decipher if the product actually suits their needs .",HIN," I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

"(HIN) So , how would you feel an elderly person watching a soccer match and shouting at peak of his voice . he has his goggles on , a bear can in hand , and say , England flag painted on him . Wo n't you feel a bit annoyed by the scene . Yes , its true that every diffrernt age group has a particular way of enjoying and even enjoying their joy . But , it 's quite a bit clear that young people enjoy thier lif to fullest than the aged . Just looking at the energy of the youngsters , the ways they enjoy and with no pressure of being ashamed , if seen by any one . The main pointof diffrentiation in youngster and an eldrly person is the energy . With body getting older , it tend to loose its energy and even the muscles weakens . When young all the body cellls are young and can store and diliver the maximum energy requied . So with this we can go on traking , dance , jump , play , and many more things . But due to lack of energy elderly people cannot enjoy much , especially the things requiring more energy . Another good reason supporting my point is , number of options available . You just cannot expect an old man to go for cycling round the beach for 10km daily . With sour joints , he has to bring lot many limitations to the kind of work he can do . In contrast , young men and women have many opitions open in the ways they can enjoy .

Last in the list , and one of important factors of social life is fear of being caught . With increasing involvement in social life , each has o take care of his image in public . So the ways to enjoy the life get limited down for a man ho has lived much of his life than a yougster . If a company boss is seen freaking around on beach is definitely pointed ou , but , if it 's his son is surely admired . Thus to conclude with , I can only say that though youngsters have more ways to enjoy life than elder people , one can surely define his enjoyment .

Wo n't you feel a bit annoyed by the scene . Yes , its true that every diffrernt age group has a particular way of enjoying and even enjoying their joy . But , it 's quite a bit clear that young people enjoy thier lif to fullest than the aged . Just looking at the energy of the youngsters , the ways they enjoy and with no pressure of being ashamed , if seen by any one . The main pointof diffrentiation in youngster and an eldrly person is the energy . With body getting older , it tend to loose its energy and even the muscles weakens .

"(SPA) I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . First of all , I think that the people today worry much more for the envioronment than in the past . The goverment and associations such as Green Peace try to get people involved to protect our planet and in my opinion their are achieving their purpouse . There are lots of people that go to work in bus and other public ways of transport , or share a car with other people to go to work every day . The governments in some countries are also trying to control the pollution by laws and restrictions such as not allowing to drive cars one day or another depending on the number plate . Another fact that I think will influence on the decrease of the number of cars in use is their price and the price of gas . Young people that start their first job do n't earn enough to buy a car and to pay for gas every month . I think the priority for them is to buy a house and since these are really expensive they do n't think about buying a car . On top of this , going by car to a big city is a huge waste of time because there is always a lot of traffic . For example , my friend Ana has to leave home at half past seven in the morning to go to work , but she does n't start until nine o'clock . After the hard day of work she leaves at half past six in the afternoon , but she does n't get home until eight o'clock . She wastes three hours every day on the road ! That is a lot of time and I think people are realising that is better to get the train because you know that you are always going to be on time and not wasting your day on the road .",SPA," I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

"(HIN) I agree with the view that in future there will be fewer cars than there are now . On the one hand , the cars are one of the most convenient mode of transportation and also the most popular one . On the other hand , the factors such as growth in population , scarcity of land and concentration of population in the urban centers indicates towards a future situation where we might actually see a reduction of cars in future . In the final analysis , there are more and stronger indications for decrease in the number of cars in future . First , due to the rising population and overcrowding in the cities , it has become extremely difficult to travel in cars as there are frequent traffic jams and lack of parking space . The other modes of transportation such as buses and trains are more convenient and faster . Further , since most of the cars are owned by people in cities the number of cars will decerases due to the above factors in the coming times . Second , the problem of pollution and overcrowding in the cities due to the increase in the number of cars have forced governments in countries like Singapore impose high taxes on purchase of vehicles . They have also imposed toll charges for entering in the main city areas . Thus , the government regulations can also discourage people from purchasing more cars and this will contribute to an overall reduction of cars in future . Third , the probelm of the scarcity of non-renewable fuels is pushing up the fuel prices everyday , making it more and more difficult to travel in cars . It has already led to the increase in popularity of the cheaper public transportation , this has been the case with trains in Mumbai ( India ) , where many people who used to travel in cars have shifted to travelling in trains and for these people new air conditioned trains have also been started . Finally , the development of the alternative means of transportations like improved buse service , better network of trains , etc can again lead to a reduction in the number of cars purchased by people and contribute to a reduction of the total number of cars in times to come .

"(GER) In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ? I am not able to support this point of view , ` though I wish I were ( for I do not only have no use for a car myself , but I also cars as being one of the major factors that cause the greenhouse effect and global warming ) . I will ( try to ) mention several possible arguments supporting the assumption that the number of cars will decrease , opposing each and evry one of them right away . After that , I will try to establish further arguments emphasizing my point of view . A traditional argument for the vanishing of cars has always been the worry about sufficient fuel supply . Considering the need for oil on the planet and the fact this natural resource is a limited one , either the number of cars will have to decrease ( for there will soon be no more fuel to run them ) or there will be new inventions in the field of motor vehicles ( such as hybrid or solar cars ) . The latter has been a great wish of ecologically-conscious people . Nevertheless , car lobbies ( trying to maintain their traditional market ) as well as oil lobbies ( trying to sell their last barrels of oil before they have to look for other occupations ) counteract such developments - with great success . There has not been a considerable evolution regarding motor vehicles which could end the dependency on oil : hybrid cars , for example , still use fossil fuel ( for otherewise they were ` pure ' ) ; solar cars on the contrary do n't have the ` performance ' which is demanded an wanted from a car . Still , the former alternative may be relevant : The end of oil . Opposing this argument , one has to mention that oil companies ( as stated above ) will attempt to sell all the oil available on the planet , which will take another 50 years approximately . Therefore , until oil 's gone , the cars remain and they 'll remain at least another 50 years . Another argument is that of the development of public transport , which is very easy to answer by referring to the countless remote places and regions on the planet , which will hardly ever be supplied with public transportation vehicles such as trains or busses . One rather sophisticated argument , the one I consider the most rational one , is the reference to the social ( infra ) structure of large cities , which makes cars often aviodable , e.g. by using subways or monorails . Yet , there are more than 6 billion people on the planet . Not all of them can inhabit such highly-developed cities and are therefor dependent on cars . To my very own mind , a very decisive argument is that cars do not only fulfil a purpose of trnsportation , but tey are also considered as status symbols . People want to ` show off ' with their cars . This need hav made ecocologally-poor companies like GM so successful , and in my mind must be a major argument for cars maintaining a plague on our planet .",GER," In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?

"(ITA) In my opinion it is very important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and , in the mean time be specialized in one specific subect . I believe that there are a lot of things that must be known by everybody . I think that what we learn at school must be the most diversified as possible . We need to study a lot of subjects and read many different critics to be able to better understand the people and the society we live in . Only by having a very wide knowledge we can understand what we really like and consequentally began to study a specific subject which can help us to work in the right way everyday . I belive that a lot of subjects are linked together and required the study of other subjects to develop a complet and good idea on a topic . For example while studying a foreign language I think it is important to study the culture , the geography , the literature and the economy of all the countriesa where that language is spoken . In this case it would be important to study sociolagy , geography and economics in addition to that foreign language grammar . Only by having such a developed knowledge we would really be able to say that we know a foreign language otherwise everytime we go to that specific country we would not know anything about it and we would feel unusefull and ignorante . I also belive that a broad knowledge is important in everyday life . For example how could we be able to read an economic article on a newspaper without knowing the basics of economics ? According to all that I said I believe that a broad knowledge is a need that each person feels inside and it is something that needs to be develloped and extended everyday by readings books or articles as well as by watching documentaries on television .",ITA," In my opinion it is very important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and , in the mean time be specialized in one specific subect .

"(GER) I agree with the statement saying that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . It is more interesting to understand concepts , because it will be a base you can use , modify or widen , whereas if you learn facts , you ca n't go further . Let 's take examples . To a student studying history it is very important to learn the facts , which is part of his knowledge . On the other sid , if he understands the logical connexions between various historical events : what led to them , which are the consequences and how they got resolved ? He will be more conscious of the subject , and thus will be able to explain it . In architecture for example , it is important to know some facts , that are milestones in the history of architecture , but what is more convincing , is not the application of facts , but the accurance of you concept when you will present your project . To me , there is a big difference between `` understanding '' and `` learning '' . If you learn something , you are only a `` recipient '' that is able to contain and to restitute information . You will not be able to talk about the subject , once you have quit the sphere of your knowledge . Whereas if you understand a topic , you do not have a mental and intellectual limit anymore which are consequences of ignorance . Nevertheless you can widen your knowledge and go beyond the limits once you have understood the ideas and concepts . In my opinion , both of them are complementary . You ca n't have a solid base if you do n't know facts , but in the same time , if you undestand ideas and concept , it will help you to learn facts . But it I had to choose , I would rather understand concepts than being limited by what i have learned .",GER," I agree with the statement saying that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

"(GER) Did one ever asked themself the question how the world would like in twenty years ? I guess everyone did . I am asked to write an essay about the following statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' . Today it is the year of 2006 . Twenty years from now would be 2026 . Popular thoughts against cars are that they are not good for our enviroment ( ozon ) so that it would be much better for the nature if the people would use trains . As well as the argument that if one takes the train one will not have to mess with traffic . Those ideas might contribute to the statement that there are going to be fewer cars in use than there are today . In my opinion I do not think that there are going to be less cars in use . A car is a really nice way to get from point A to point B. One is not dependent on the bus or the train . It is nice to have the opportunity to use public transportation but one also has to rely on them . Most of the time the bus does not drive when one wants to be at a certain place . For example , if a student wants to be at school at 8.00 a.m. but the bus only arrives there either at 8.05 or at 7.35 , he will have to be 5 minutes late or wait for half an hour . Having a car is much more convenient for that matter . I am sure that people will not stop driving cars because of them harming the ozon . People destroy nature all the time . People already know about the problem and do not do anything about it so they will not stop driving all the sudden because of that matter . If one takes a closer look at the argument that traffic might people hold back from using cars , one can see that a train or bus has its places where they need to stop and their certain routes . By taking a bus one might even waste more time than being stuck in traffic . It always depends on where on lives though . I would recommend taking the train in large city like NYC . But taking the car outside of the city . I came to the conclusion that one needs to differenciate between the city and the suburbs/country .

"(ITA) When we know a specific topic or we discuss an argument , and we are well aware of what we write or speak about , most of the times we bring ideas , concepts and facts . The idea and concept are necessary to be able to define and describe a general concept . If we start any description , it is necessary that first we have a clear and defined general information about it and that we can put it above all the necessary explanations we have to give in support of it .

People want to be free , do not want to depend on buses , trains and any other transportation choices , if they have the capability of enduring its cost . In twenty years there will be more cars on the ways than there are today for following reasons . First of all , people work harder and earn much more money by the improvements of the technology and they want to take benefits of this , so they prefer owning their private cars rather than using public transportation vehicles . Even they buy cars for their childeren when they entered an university so in one home usually two or three cars are being used . Although it can be thought that the sources of energy to move a car , the petrolium will be scarce , not available by the time passes and petrolium sources will finish , I believe more convenient ways will be popular in the near future such as solar energy or bor material will be used as a source of energy in the car 's motor . Nowadays we also see the signs of this new useges . Also the cost of car will be reduced because the automobile companies will be trying to spread the car useges among the people , fighting against the government policies that are done to improve public transportation and make it more popular .

You can give your contribute only with a simple deed and with a simple attention towards who is suffering or is asking your help . At this common sense contribute the bad examples that television and internet give : almost every famous person s only interested to go to the parties , to have vacations in wonderful places , .. About my personal experience i can say i have never helped my community . In part , this is due to my past and present involving in studies but also in sport activities . In my normal day i have to stay up to 8 hours to the university and then i have to train myself in my favourite sport , the taekwondo . When i come back home i neither can watch the tv without sleeping in front of it . Honestly i also must come clean that i am really really lazy . In fact i desrcribed above not my life in the weekend , but also during the weeek . If i could , i would help my comunity in the weekends like some friends of mine do . But , on fridays and saturdays evenings , i want to enjoy myself until the earlier hours in the day . This implies that i am too tired on sundays for help my community taking , for example , dinners or lunches to old people who cannot move from their home",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(CHI) I strongly agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites . Being a volunteer myself at the National University Hospital for more than three years , I have sensed that the communities does need a lot of help from the general public . However , the young people involved in this project are extremely few . There are numerous reasons for this phenomenon . The first reason would be a lack of interest . We face a great difficulty to recruit people every year . They are simply attracted to other booths that are considered more interesting , such as Outdoor Activities Club , Dance Society and Rock Climbing Club . These activities involve a lot of physical movement and help them to bond better with their friends . They have a golden chance to know more about people from their age and build firmer friendship via such activities . Helping the communities , on the other hand , usually requires the interaction with people outside the school . Most of the time , they are from another age group . It is very difficult to get the young people interested or excited to talk with the elderly patients for two hours straight or to play with kids who hardly know any ` hot ' music or movies . Young people believe that they could hardly gain anything out of helping the communities . As a result , most of them are not interested . This also explains why Ministry of Education in Singapore sets compulsory hours of community service for the Junior College students . If not , young people would not set time aside for such activities . Secondly , time contraint usually hinders the young people to helping their communities . Young people nowadays are preoccupied with simply too many activities , such as school work , co-curriculum activities and other entertainment programs . In Singapore universities , we have to attend lectures , laboratories , tutorials and seminars for almost 30 hours a week . During our spare time , we have numerous project meetings , assignments , essays and tests to prepare and study for . In our mere free time , we tend to relax by chatting on MSN , surfing the Internet , playing computer games , watching movies or joining club activities such as bridge club , skating club , outdoor activities club etc . This simply leaves us little time to help the communities . Thirdly , young people , especially people from rich families , are not mature enough to face the reality in the communities . Grown up in a wealthy family who live in condominiums or private houses , young people do not see the other side of the society . They do not recognize the existence of people who work 14 hours a day and earn a meager income , who live on public pensions of 200 dollars a month ( equivalent for the cost of their newly bought Nike shoes ) , who live in a house without electricity and gas supply , who are sick but have no money to see a doctor and who are too weak to see the sun-rise on the next morning . Helping their communities provides too cruel a reality for them to accept . As a result , they opt to escape from facing them completely . In conclusion , it is my stand that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

The one problem that has a great effect in our social lives is youngsters not helping their communities as they used to do in the past . Needless to say that this has its reasons too . Two main reasons why youngsters are more selfish and care less about their families and everyone around them today are their parents and lack of education given in this direction .

They immitate how their parents handle situations and they internalize most of the altitudes their parents exhibit under certain situations at a very young age . Therefore when a little girl , say Allice sees her mother being careless to other people around her , she just grows up to be that way . She becomes more self-centered , individualist and less helpful to others . That may be a person having a stroke on the street , or an elder who needs a seat on the bus . She will just choose of her comfort and well-being and care less about other people . Even though most of the children grow up with the company of their parents , they also spend most of their time at schools they attend to . In schools they take the teacher as the model especially at the younger ages and their education has a great influence on what kind of a person they will be .

Today , by contrast , we can observe an increasing specialization and academic education becomes more and more focused , almost narrow minded , training people from the start only for a specific subject . While I would agree that given the amount of knowledge available on specifis issues and the scarcity in the labour market , it is important to be very knowledgeable in one particular field . Being a true expert is important in order to be able to compete with other people in the same field and to enhance knowledge and promote progress in research on that specialized field . However , specialists should not loose sight of the context in which they carry out their work and should always be aware of the broader social , economic and political implications their results may have . To give an example , one could think of the physicists or engineers that contribute to the development of nuclear energy .

"(JPN) I think young people enjoy life more than older people do . This can be said from my own experiences and from what I see from other people 's experiences . One of the reasons I think this is because , younger people have more power or stamina to do things . For example , if a 50-year old person were to play baseball , he/she would have a hard time in hitting the ball and running to the base , and catching a ball and throwing it . As for the younger people , they still have a lot of strength and energy left to move around and use as much power as they want . Younger people have an advantage that they are able to move quicker and stronger compared to older people , so I think younger people would enjoy sports more than older people . In my own experience , my dad and I were playing catch . I could throw really fast at my dad , but my dad could n't throw that fast . I think this was because he got tired faster than I did , or he did n't have much strength so he could n't throw a ball like he used to when he was young . We can see that if we get older , our choices of what we can do will decrease . Another example that young people enjoy life more than older people is that young people can fool around more compared to older people . This can be said because if an adult were to jump around naked in his/her yard , he would get caught by the police . On the other hand , if a 5-year old boy were to jump around naked in his yard , he obviously would n't get caught . As you can see , older people have more restrictions compared to young people .

"(GER) I agree to the statement , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them learn facts . First of all , the motivation of learning should be to know the things , to fulfill the thirst of knowledge . This ambition should be the reason , why somebody decides to study at an university . Second , if somebody learns only facts , it will be even harder to keep the facts . The human memory has evolved by nature in order to better survive on this planet . At these times it was helpful to understand ideas and concepts , for example , understanding nature in favour to use it . Therefore the human is not suited to learn facts , in comparison to the computer . It could be asked , why students have to learn facts at all ? The reason is simple . Facts are needed to be present in the mind to construct or to follow a theory as much as bricks and stones are needed to construct an house . If students do n't learn any facts , they ca n't follow any theory , which rely on facts . Therefore it is neccessary to learn facts , but the motivation for it should be to understand ideas and concepts . Learning facts has to be viewed like a tool , which some people like to use and some people do n't , but the reason to use the tool does n't lie in the tool itself . As I described above , the human mind is not intended to learn facts . But to develop a complicated theory , it is neccessary to know facts . Therefore the society created rewards for using learning facts . A teacher rewards a student , if he learns well and if he learns facts accurately . Some students are attracted so much by these rewards , that they only learn facts to achieve the reward . Everybody of us experienced them in the school class , where some pupils learned very ambitiously and accurately , but it was easy to see , that they prefered receiving the reward instead of satisfying their thirst of knowledge . As a solution to this phenomena at school , I propose to reward the understanding of ideas and concepts much more then just learning the facts . The pupils need the discipline to the learn facts , but they also need to see , why the are learning them .",GER," I agree to the statement , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them learn facts .

Learning facts has to be viewed like a tool , which some people like to use and some people do n't , but the reason to use the tool does n't lie in the tool itself . As I described above , the human mind is not intended to learn facts . But to develop a complicated theory , it is neccessary to know facts . Therefore the society created rewards for using learning facts . A teacher rewards a student , if he learns well and if he learns facts accurately . Some students are attracted so much by these rewards , that they only learn facts to achieve the reward . Everybody of us experienced them in the school class , where some pupils learned very ambitiously and accurately , but it was easy to see , that they prefered receiving the reward instead of satisfying their thirst of knowledge . As a solution to this phenomena at school , I propose to reward the understanding of ideas and concepts much more then just learning the facts . The pupils need the discipline to the learn facts , but they also need to see , why the are learning them .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(KOR) Many people have a different idea on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize on one specific subject . People who support the idea insist that having broad knowledge of academic subjects is more useful their future life . However I storngly dissagree the idea for two reasons . First , speciallizing in one specific subject can recieve a good grade during the school time . Second it can procure a professional job . First of all , speciallizing in one specific subject can recieve a good grade during the school time . That is because it make students to focus on one specific subject .

Also , the access to a wide range of study subjects will help us to foster a good thinking mode to reason the any academic issue from a high-level perspective before we go any further . However , the knowledge the learner get through this way may not be much substantial at the cost of the wide range . Specific subject , on the other hand , will benefit the learner , with an in-depth knowledge and skill sets , which are critical to explore in the certain field and to get substantial understanding of the major he works on . Only with intensive training in the specific subject , one could be expected to make impressive achievement in this field . Comparing the advantages and charecteristis of the broad knowledge and specific subject , we can tell that they help people in different ways .

Although , first steps have been made to reduce globl warming , the issue is still not treated with the earnesty and conviction it deserves so far .

Consequently , the question wether there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years is of vital importance to us all . I would like to answer with a definite yes . However , I think otherwise . One of the main reasons for this conviction is , that people have known about global warming for a long time , but that consequent action , such as driving less has been taken only by a small minority . People love convenience , and cars are very convenient . Moreover cars are very important symbols of status for many people . Feelings have a greater influence on most people than rational thought , and this is why they will not give up their cars if they don not have to . Another reason why I think that the number of cars will increase , is that large numbers of people in the so called third world , especially in China , who did not have cars so far , are starting to buy them . Ony a drastic increase in petrolem prices could slow this developement . Less pessimistic reasons for my view , are that new cars are beeing developed .

There ' s a part of the young people , unfortunatly not so wide , which spends a lot of time in helping the community , for example , volountaries , social assistants , or actuating a positive political activity in the school ambit or in the society . They try to do their best to improve social conditions and to solve communities problems because they thik that is important to give their contribute . In fact another probable reason for the lack of interest among young people in such problems is the considering these problem without a solution and the thought that their contribute would not be useful . This is in many case the easiest and comfortable way of not taking our own responsbilities and fill not guilty for not taking care of problems which add",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(TUR) In today 's academic world , one can see increased specification among different disciplines : even in the same discipline there are different subfields on which academicians focus .

This , of course , would create a mode of trust , confidence and cooperation between the young and the community .

"(HIN) I would disagree with the statement , `` In twenty years there will be a fewer cars in use than there are today '' , for many reasons . Firstly , i believe that the automobile industry is burgeoning and the number of cars manufactured by them is increasing in an exponential manner and therfore the use of the cars is increasing as well . The population of the world has increased and hence the demand for owning a car as increased as well . In the present world people who even earn a mimimal annual income are also buying cars because of the offers such as paying in installments , available to them from the various car vendors . Hence the use of the cars have gone up and will continue to rise as there will be better offers available to middle-class people . Another reason according to me would be that , the variety of the cars available in the market keeps getting upgraded frequently . Every new car has a newer technology or some additional feature that makes it better than its predecessor . This attracts people to buy a new one in addition to the one they might already own . This leads to more cars on road and therfore adding to the use of them and we can imagine much better cars in twenty years from now as well . Another example i would like to sate is that in a country like India there is no law against cars older that 15 years . This adds to the fact that since the cars are not being recycled or carshed , the number of cars on road are just adding up and so is the use of them .

I believe that young people really do n't give enough time to helping their communities . I will argue the statement for some follwing reasons . First of all , parents nowadays expect their children can get high education , so children 's activity always studying not communities . Because the society becomes more and more wealthy , parents have much time to take care of their child for their performing in class . For example , in order to achieve their expectation of education , parents usually take their child to cram school , that really occupy much time for young people . Secondly , Because of the developing game producing , young people nowadays usually stay home for playing game not go out to communicate with others . For instance , It is fashion to play PS2 nowadays , young people in order to get high grades in the game , they have no interest to go out or make more friends , and they even do n't have any time to commuciate with other people . To sum up , Because of the high educated expectation and the fascinating games , young people nowadays focus on books or games instead of communities . Therefore , It is my preference that young people do n't give enough time to helping thire comunities nowadays .

"(CHI) Nowadays , more and more people say that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do . They think that many young people buy the luxruy things , spend more and more time and money on the internet and video games . The older people , however , always spend theri time to do the housework , or watch the TV at home . But does it true that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do ? I think I cannot agree with this saying . Because every peorid of one 's life has its own features . We cannot only say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do . Firstly , older people always think everything in their way , so maybe they think the next generation always not good as them . For example , the kids who were born in 1960's and after were called The Generation Ca n't Support . But they are the main part of the economy and poltic now . They are excellent as their father and grandfather . So the viewpoint that the young people enjoy life more than older people is just a stereotype . Secondly , I think every old people has ever been young before . So they must know that the young people is much more active than older people . They know go to club or play basketball when they are free . They cannot stop moving . But it is not to enjoy the life , it is the instinctive of the young man . That not means that the young man enjoy the life more the older people . Thirdly , many older people know how to enjoy the life more than the young people . Because many young people do n't have enough money to enjoy the life . They need to word . But the older people who has earned enough money to use during the holiday , or buy the expensive cars , etc . So the older people maybe know how to enjoy the life more than young people .",CHI," Nowadays , more and more people say that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do . They think that many young people buy the luxruy things , spend more and more time and money on the internet and video games . The older people , however , always spend theri time to do the housework , or watch the TV at home . But does it true that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do ? I think I cannot agree with this saying . Because every peorid of one 's life has its own features . We cannot only say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do . Firstly , older people always think everything in their way , so maybe they think the next generation always not good as them . For example , the kids who were born in 1960's and after were called The Generation Ca n't Support . But they are the main part of the economy and poltic now . They are excellent as their father and grandfather . So the viewpoint that the young people enjoy life more than older people is just a stereotype . Secondly , I think every old people has ever been young before . So they must know that the young people is much more active than older people . They know go to club or play basketball when they are free . They cannot stop moving . But it is not to enjoy the life , it is the instinctive of the young man . That not means that the young man enjoy the life more the older people . Thirdly , many older people know how to enjoy the life more than the young people . Because many young people do n't have enough money to enjoy the life . They need to word . But the older people who has earned enough money to use during the holiday , or buy the expensive cars , etc . So the older people maybe know how to enjoy the life more than young people .",KOR+CHI+JPN
"(KOR) I disagree with the statement . Young people have hard time loving their life because of the stage of adolescence . On the other hand , older people spend their lives as they want to because they are far more experienced than the young . I am a teenager , and I have seen a lot of my friends struggling in their lives because they do not know what they should be doing . Also , this is the time of adolescence where many teenagers view the world differently from adults or children , and often become too emotional or revolting . For example , when I first enrolled in my high school , I was very depressed . This was because I kept believing that school was a place where young people my age were being measured by the grades that they received . As I kept thinking that this was a horrid idea of recognizing one individual as good or bad , I found anger in my self , and I could not enjoy my life . I also did not know what field I wanted to persue my career in , so I was very confused and pressured . I think this time of my life was a time of struggle because I was quite young and did not have enough experience in life to make important decisions . Being young means learning about life and going through different emotions . Young poeple suffer internally and this is why I believe that young people do not always enjoy life more than older people . My grandparents are one example of why I think that elders enjoy life more than that of the young ones . Since my grandparents are both retired from their jobs , they have plenty of leisure time to spend . My grandparents travel every month to different places in the world . Since they have earned enough money in their younger years , my grandparents are able to entertain themselves more than others . Also , they have more life experience , which means that my grandparents are able to figure out what is the most fun and benefitial to themselves . Like this , I believe that older people can live a free life , doing whatever takes them to be happy . Young people often have to go through difficulties in their lives , such as finding their true talent , peer pressure and worries on how they will survive in the `` real '' world . On the other hand , older people can live a relaxed life doing what they find the most joy in . They also have more experience in living , so they are wiser and know what is best for them .

"(GER) I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning facts . First of all if you want to understand ideas and concepts you have to do a lot of research . For example Galileo Galilei had do a lot of research before he understood that the earth is not flat and is instead a ball . It took him about twenty years . For normal students to understand some physic problems , we have to do also a lot of research in our book or on the internet . If you start doing research it gives you the opportunity do think about the idea and learn something about it . Another reason why I think it 's more important to understand ideas then fact is , that fact sometimes sem really clear . We know for a fact that Adolf Hitler killed himself . If you would study the facts you woul study only his dead . Instead if you are studyieng ideas and concepts , you will learn why he killed himself and why he all did this . For me a fact is something short wich we do n't have to study , but an idea or a concept is something big you need to do some research on . Finally , if you are learning to understand the idea and concept you can use your studies in live . If you studied the idea how a car is working you can work at a carshop and repair cars , but if you only learnend the fact that cars have a motor you will be not able to build a car . When you study to understand ideas and concepts you learn way more about life , then if you just study facts . Facts do n't give the background were you can ask `` why '' .

"(GER) I disagree with the presented statement . I think it is better to have an specific knowledge about an academic subject than having a wide range of academic knowledge . To underline my opinion I would like to refer some arguments and examples . First , I would like to refer my own experiences when I was studying law at university . There was a mass of students that started with me in my first semester . About 300 students had for several years the same courses , so we were all taught the same general subjects . There was no difference between the students , though the number of students was so high . Is it possible that 300 people like to be taught in the same way ? This was something that disturbed me very much . In order to get rid of that academic unity I refused to listen to each lecture and started to read books on subjcts I was interessted in and got specialised by myself . Second , you have to keep in mind that you need to get a job . I think most of the jobs are very specialised and you will need certain skills and knowlegde to get your work done . This is why you have to specify in one or two subjects before . Then it would be to late for you to specialise . A as result you have to conclude , that it is better to specialise early in order to get a good job . Third , of course I have to admit that there are so many things that are interessting to be dealt in class . In that general way it is granted that you also learn about things you were not interested in ( yet ) . Perhaps you find out more about other subjects , that you did not get in contact with , because you were specialised .

"(FRE) Everybody has learnt from people in school , at home , concepts and ideas which we have to learn , and wee could call that education . But , in a life in general , each is confronted to different scenarii , situation , people , which impact behaviour or vision of life . That 's why i will try to express my opinion linking both of argument and showing importance of each . First , let 's talk about ideas and concepts , which are essential for student in order to have key elements and after to use them to make their personal opinion . I think learning the basis such as respect people , the law , history , are key ressources for the student , since they want to have in their possession the key values which allow them to advance in the society and to judge it by theirself .

"(HIN) The best and most popular mode of trivelling today is a car . You can reach any where at your own time schedule with the help of a car . It does overcome some of the disadvantages of other systems such as bus , Train etc . To trivel by Train or Bus we have to go by their schedule , and they can be used to reach only specific locations . But the future is not so good for the cars . I agree with the statement that twenty years from now thier will be ferwer cars than today . Cars require fuel to run . Today the fuel used is mainly Petroleium or Natural Gas in the form of LPG or CNG . These are fossile fuels and they are non renewable , so they will tend to decrease over the time . The supply of these fuels will decrease over the time . so they will become more expensive to afford by normal people . As a result number of car owners will decrease . Cars make lot of polution which is responsible for various health and environment related problems such as global worming or lung cancer . The problems related to the cars are all related to the fuel they are using . So if we can get the alternate energy souce to run a car then it may have the bright future and we can see more cars than ever in next 20 years . The alternative energy souce for this fossile fuels is solar energy , or Fuel cells , which use hydrogen as their fuel . The problem with use of Fuel cells is that it requires carring hidrogen along with the car . Hidrogen is very explosive if it is exposed to atmosphere , so carring hidrogen along with the car is like sitting on a bomb . As far as other option goes , there are very few cars which run on solar energy today , this is mainly because these cars are expensive . But as the technology grows these cars may be affordable and can be available for use for resonable price . The other point that we should note that world is going towards globalization . It means increase in the competition . So people will require faster routes to trivel . Todays cars are limited in speed not only due to the car itself but due to over crowding of cars , remember the time we spent in trafic . so in order to promote the car in future one need to see to these issues as well . Answering all these questions will shape the future of cars . So twenty years from now , if we see cars in musiums or on roads in day today life will depend on all these issues .",HIN," The best and most popular mode of trivelling today is a car .

For example , when I was in secondary school , I would rather spend the time on playing game by computer than playing game with my friend in playground or house . Thus , such a indivisualism allows people concentrate on just oneself , thereby making people spend more time in their house and not giving enough time to helping their communities .

"(FRE) Young people clearly do not help their communities as much as they once did . But their change is mostly due to the change of the whole world and the society we live in . The last century has seen many technological revolutions such as television and computer and a consequent change was more than expectable . Now that studies are getting so long for youngs the free time they could potentially spend for their community has been drastically reduced . Big cities that have been growing all over the world lately have also somehow reduced youngs activity in a comunity so big that sometimes does't make them feel at home . Now that the world is accessible to anyone and the youngs travel everywhere they loose the sense of home that someone that has always lived in only one village could feel . That 's why who lives in small cities knowing everyone inside them and staying there for their whole life has a much bigger sense of belonging at his town and is much more keen to help out anyone . But that is not the only reason . Something that plays a major part is the education people get from school and most of all from their family . The new family model in the Occidental world complitely degraded . Almost half of the over 30 years old people has been divorce at least once . Their support to the children can only be drastically worse than it once was . People who grow in a solid family close to their brothers , their parents but also to their grand-parents and their old traditional values will without any doubt stay closer to their community . I 've personally got a lot of doubt about how this new condition can improve . I think a moral change is almost impossible and people will have to adapt .

"(FRE) Nowadays , we can see a lot of cars in all streets of the world in spite of the growth of th price of the oil . I think it wo n't change in twenty years . I think that people want to be more and more indepedant and the car is one of the signes of this independance because you can go where you want when you want , you just have to pay the oil . The need of move is very important for the man and people prefers take their car instead of the bus for exemple . And it 's why I think cars will not disappear with the time , but the oil , will do . It 's a big ecological problem because oil pollutes a lot the ozone , and we must find new way of cars energy in the future like alcohol , it 's already done in some countries like Brazil for exemple . It is also a political conflict , as I said after , poorests countries than France , like Brazil , had already adopted new energy but for richest countries , it 's a way of earning money because there are a lot of taxes on the oil . The society of consommation and benefits we live in is also a preponderant factor , because people are attract to buy more and more , they are touched by the advertisement done by all manufacturers , and if you close cars manufacturers , it will have big consequencies on the market , and create unemployment . But by the same way , if you reduce the use of the cars , you must create new underground structure so it will create temporary workers which can be helpfull for the unemployment of people who are not qualified for another job . However , a thing that we must know is that for the 2006 year , the statistics shows that the sales of cars have dicrease for a lot of big company like Renault . To conclude , it is very difficult to predict the future of the cars market , but from my point of view , I can not live whithout my car , I am keen on driving .

Most of the people use their cars to go to the offices or work place , and you can use your own car to travel to different places instead of hiring a cab . The cost of cars have come down in recent years making it easy for common people to buy them and most banks and financial institutes provide different schemes to purchase a car . Through these schemes most of the middle class families buy a car for their personal use . If you own a car , you need not worry in a emergency situations like calling the ambulance for sudden health problems of family members .

They can move around the city and go to any place they wish to . If they have their own vechile they wo n't be any problem for a late night party . They wo n't have any problem look for a cab in the late night to get back home . And as resale markets have come up , people sell their old cars for a new one .

"(SPA) Whether it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide or just by your own , has both advantages and disadvantages depending on many factors or characteristics of the trip . Three importants factors are : the amount of money the person has , for how much time he will be travelling , and the personal oppinion about flexibility . Firstly , hireing a tour guide can be very expensive and , in some cases , much more expensiver that travelling alone . For example , it is free to go through Paris walking on your own , and it can be very expensive to pay for a group tour . Nonetheless , you will probably need to buy a guide if you do not want to miss the important places . It is cheaper to walk on your own only if the guide is not as expensive as the tour . Secondly , a guided tour works better for someone who has not got too much time to visit a place . In this case , he will have someone to take him to the unmissable places and to give him some explanations . On the other hand , if someone has , for example , three month to visit two cities , he will probably have time to get around on his own , ask for some advise to different local people and see or visit much more different places than the number of places he would visit on a guided group tour . The third factor has to do with preferences . People have different oppinion about how much flexibility they like to have when they are travelling , and there is not only one correct or a best oppinion . Some people like to have a schedule that details every place they will visit , and what they will do every day . However , other people like to feel free to do what they feel like doing on each day , depending , for example , on their mood . In spite of the fact that a person can make a detailed schedule when travelling alone , on guided tours , people are usually less free to do what they feel like doing on that day .

It is the perfect stage of life to learn , experience and recognize the values that were transmited to us . It is also a period in which young people could enjoy the opportunity to demonstrate their affection and love to older people , knowing that some day they will also get older and in demand of affection and attention .

As a result , traveling in a group can make people feel frustrated and quite dissappointed . In addition , it is hard to travel around some places where they want to .

"(SPA) I agree with this statement based on my experience of traveling . First of all if you contract a guide you can be sure that you are hiring an expert in what you are a complete ignorant and therefore he will do it , for sure , twice as good as you . To begin with a very good reason of choosing a guide we can say that it will be cheaper because he knows the place and cost of the attractions and in case you want to see a show that is held in two different establishments at the same time he could recommend you the cheaper , furthermore the decrease in other expenses like lodging , food , etc. will surely yield that the money you are wasting in your tourist guide will be less than the money you are saving . Other important reason is that you wo n't get lost , for example , once when I visited Barcelona I did n't want to get a guide because we only had a few hours to stay in the town , my surprise was when we almost lost half of the time looking for a monument instead of taking advantage of the amazing harbor or other events there . The last advantage of having this person in a tourist group is that he knows the city and he will warn you of certain dangerous zones of the city or disabled roads , a personal reference of this reason has happen to me a year ago when my family and I went for vacations in Seattle , we were walking in downtown without a guide and admiring the amazing skyscrapers of the city when suddenly we realized that it was getting dark , and of course we did n't know that that zone inthe night is a little creepy ( of course , no map warns you about that ) and when we decided to go back to the car we were in the middle of hundreds of welfare people begging for money , fortunately no disasters happened to us but it was a lesson that I will never forget .

"(CHI) I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Firstly , I think that to enjoy life has nothing to do with the age . Older people can enjoy life as much as young people do . Sometimes older people even know more about how to enjoy life and enjoy life more because they are older than the young people and realize what is more precious to the life . For example , when my mother was young , she wanted to earn more money and brought up the child in a big house . She worked hard . She had little time to stay with the children . When she was old , the children all left and went to university in another city or even in another country . She realized that she would have spent more time with the children when the children stayed at home if she had been young again . Obviously nothing is more delightful and memorable than to enjoy yourself with your dear childrens . There are also many examples that the young people regret the days that they would enjoy the life better . Secondly , we have many ways to enjoy the life . The ways are not better or worse . They are not less or more . Young people may want to dance , to sing , to skate or to climb the mountain . Older people prefer reading , watching television or just watching the sunset by the sea . During the different period in our life , we have different ways to enjoy life . Life can be as active as a tiger and life can also be quiet and calm as a small river . We enjoy life in the different period . When we are young , we want to challenge and to take risk . When we are older , we can enjoy the peacefulness and normal happines in the life . In a word , I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . It is not a question of age . In fact , it is a question of attitude . We can enjoy life in any stage of our life as long as we know how to appreciate the beauty of the life and to cherish what we have possessed .",CHI," I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

If now there are six thousend million of people wich most of them no have car , and knowing that the countries not develop are developing now ( like China , Brazil or India ) or will develop in the next ten years , the people of these countries will buy cars . In addittion , the developing countries there are two cars per family in now days , with the emigration the number of families are raising , so more cars . And I want to add that the tecnology is there to make the cars more confortable and with more security . On the other hand , cars pollute the enviorement and people are now more conciounsly in protect the Earth and the ozone . This could be affect in the market of the cars in the world because people is using and will use more and more public transport in order to protect the Earth . Also is important that the natural resources are been used in more cuantity for all the products ( plastic , fuel , natural gas , etc ) and the cars need combustible to work and now the natural resources are growing in use .

"(ARA) Generally , I do agree that young people enjoys life more than older people , because it is a matter of fact that young people lives in less stresses and responsibilities than older do . From another perspective the lack of maturity might be one of the major reasons for this enjoyment , also no much attention is paid to the consequences of any action made by the young . Furthermore the youngsters enjoys life more due to less exploration and expectations than older people which involves exitement , the older we get , the more we know and expect even if we are travelling to a new site , while for example if you observe a kid in a park you can tell the difference in the approach and the movement while olders are setting still because they till them selves that I already know the feeling . On the other hand the more younger the less mind occupation and complexity while proceeding in life , you find the teenagers with bigger smile and exitment than the college boy who started thinking of his career and how good his GPA should be , who is any way more happier than a recently married man with more responsibilities on his shoulders , not to mention a man spousing a wife and a group of children and responsible financially about their schooling and clothing , as we can note that pressures and responsibilities gets accelerated when we grow older which unfortunatly minimizes the joy in our lives .

"(GER) In my opinion , there are both , advantages and disadvantages about trying new things and taking risks .

I used to be the person who does not take a lot of risk in the past , but recently my attitude has changed . I think that being successful in life , just can be achieved by trying new things and taking risks . For example , a member of a football team .

"(FRE) I think I would agree with the statement that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . Having vast knowledge in several kind of subjects allows you to have an opinion on such or such topic whereas if you specialize in only one area of study , you cannot form a rich opinion on any other area of study but your own . If you take the French academic system versus the American one . It clearly shows this difference . In France , when you enter university you have to choose a section , for example If I want to major in English , I wo n't be able to add psychology as a minor . So you have to specialize yourself quite early . Although this system tends to change , little by little , now with the ECTS system , which basically premits French students to go and study through Europe with the transfer of their credits and vice versa .. Whereas in the United States , each class is assigned to a specific number of credits , during your first two years of college you are able to choose within the large catalog of classes as long as you get a enough credits to validate your academic year .

In terms of the education facts help to understand how things develop , For example , how human being appeared in this world . There are some natural concepts , ideas and theories that are just that supositions but the fact is that the human being exist and we do n't have still an aswer . As a conclusion , the relation between ideas , concepts and facts are close . The first two develop the las one . The reason why is better to know ideas and concepts is beausea in this way you can find a fact",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(ITA) I really hope that in few years the number of cars go down ! Today the cars in our cities are too much : our air is drammatically polluted and this is because of the cars ; there is also a lot of traffic and sometimes you take one hour to go only on the other side of your city . I think that today all of people and governments have understand that the problem is big and important : probably in the next years they are going to approve some politics in order to reduce the number of cars and to offer some substitutive service or to improve the ones that exist . I 'm speaking about bus , for short or medium travels , and trains . I think that the govern and the citizen af all the word have to cry to obtain this . I think that petrol companies and car industries that probably wants the number of cars increas in the next day ; ca n't be heard by the government because the most important things are our wealth and quality of life . For a family of four persons is today quite normal to have two or three cars . I think this is very dangerous for our society . If there are a lot of cars the problem is first of all the pollution , that i think is drammatically important and is necessary a solution very soon . Other problems are the traffic and the parking . For all these reason i think that there will not be fewer cars in use in the next years because is really dangerous for the population .

"(HIN) I strongly disagree with this statement as the need for personal transportation will be even more in next twenty years than what it today is .

(FRE) Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . I agree with the following statement . I think that trying new things is good for the world and help us to do better and have a better life . People who know about one topic want to change what they know . For example the scientists already know a lot of things about the deseases but they are still struggling to give us a better life and better chance to stay alive . The successful people are successful because they demonstrate a new things for the life on earth . They want to know more because they want to improve the quality of life and also earn lot of money . We have computers since a long time but every time people work on it to improve it and make it easy for us to work . I think that the world is running and all the things in this world have to run too . At the past we had the airplanes but they are not like those for today . People make it faster and agreable for customers . They take risks because they believe in what they are doing . As a result they win the challenge and make a lot of money . By trying new things they are learning new things and they use those things to create special machines . At the past we had a telephone which was big and was very uncomfortable .

"(GER) The question about broad oder specialized education is rather difficult to solve . In my opinion there is no clear answer or solution to this problem . I think that a broad knowledge of many subjects is essential to succeed in work . For example in economics , is is very important to have certain knowledge of law , mathematics or information systems to only mention a few connected fields of study . Without background knowledge in these fields you will not be able to get a good degree in your study . Also it is important to have knowledge of culture and society , especially when you want to work and live in other countries . Here it is extremely neccessary that you learn something about the culture of the foreign country , so that you can live there as a part of the community . Also everybody should have a basic knowledge about the history of his country or geographical circumstances of the region he lives in . This knowledge can be seen of a basis that every person succeeding university should achieve . But beneath this broad knowledge it also is quite useful to have a highly specialised knowledge in one certain field . In this specialized subject , you then can enjoy being a expert . This can not only be good for your personal career . If nobody wanted a highly specialized training , there would be no progress in science . Here we have good examples in natural sciences , for example physics . Every student of physics needs a basic education that also includes mathematics and chemistry . But to research in problems , that matter at present time , you need to highly specialize , because there is so much information , that a single human being would never be able to gain it all .

"(TEL) I think young people definately enjoy life more than old people do or ever did . In the olden days , there was a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of the younger generation . However , the more laid-back lifestyle of the 21st century allows youngsters to have more than their share of fun . Nevertheless , there are always limits as too much of a good thing is also bad . With all the responsibility on the older generation , the younger generation does not even feel the need to be role models for their siblings . Children , with all their innocence find joy in the most mundane places . A tiny chocolate makes a child smile ear to ear whereas an adult striking a million dollar deal is overcome by greed instead of being proud and happy . Children can enjoy the little aspects of life which go unnoticed by the older generation . I would like to illustrate an example from my own experiences . When my family visited Thailand in june 2004 , we were all very enthusiastic as the entire family would be meeting up after five years . We all had a blast jet sking , parachute sailing etc . It was only later that we realised that our parents did not get this opportunity as they did not have enough money at that time . In our merriment we had forgotten about them and they , not wanting to disappoint us did not say a word . This is a very trifle example but for the first time I realised how much elders do to make our life more enjoyable than theirs . As we grow more mature , our definition of fun keeps changing . Initially fun was synonomous to PS 2's and partying but as we grow older we mellow down . We realise that fun and responsibility are a package deal called life . When you are dependent on someone , its like your insured and you have no cause for worry . When you get past being a teenager and people start depending on you , you are their insurance and therefore have responsibility . This is not necessarily a bad thing as it instills in you a sense of independence and pride . A little fun is always necessary for anyone - young or old to lead a happy , healthy life .",TEL," I think young people definately enjoy life more than old people do or ever did .

"(FRE) To tell the truth , I do not think that concepts are more important than facts . To my mind , both of them are significant and essential in a student 's training . First at all , I am convinced that understanding concepts and ideas are really important for a student . Indeed , learning facts can become very useless and it is impossible to understand those facts without understanding their origin . Theory is essential in a student 's training and a student can not devote his time on facts he can not understand . However , if a students only learn concepts , he rapidly has trouble likening experience and theory . Consequently , I think it is very important to learn facts for many reasons . First , when a student learn facts , he can on the one hand , learn a situation , and on the other hand the mistakes made during this situation . Furthermore , general knowledge is essential . First , in order to have his own opinion concerning a topic , and then , to liken those facts to an experience . For example , I am major in Material . I have learnt a lot of facts concerning different microstructures , and when I carry out an experience , I can observe a microstructure I can easily liken to what I have learnt before . As a consequence , I think that in order to understand the theory , it is essential to learn facts . Concepts are essential in a student 's training but a students can not make the most of those concepts if he can not liken them to an experience .

To my mind , both of them are significant and essential in a student 's training . First at all , I am convinced that understanding concepts and ideas are really important for a student . Indeed , learning facts can become very useless and it is impossible to understand those facts without understanding their origin . Theory is essential in a student 's training and a student can not devote his time on facts he can not understand . However , if a students only learn concepts , he rapidly has trouble likening experience and theory . Consequently , I think it is very important to learn facts for many reasons . First , when a student learn facts , he can on the one hand , learn a situation , and on the other hand the mistakes made during this situation . Furthermore , general knowledge is essential . First , in order to have his own opinion concerning a topic , and then , to liken those facts to an experience . For example , I am major in Material . I have learnt a lot of facts concerning different microstructures , and when I carry out an experience , I can observe a microstructure I can easily liken to what I have learnt before . As a consequence , I think that in order to understand the theory , it is essential to learn facts . Concepts are essential in a student 's training but a students can not make the most of those concepts if he can not liken them to an experience .

"(JPN) Some people are of the opinion that the best way to travel is to take a trip by alone . Such people tend to think that they feel more comfortable taking a travel alone as they do not have to follow the schedules and intentions of others . In my opinion , however , the best way to travel is in a group by tour guide . This essay will discuss the two key reasons to support my opinion in more detail below . First , I am definitely of the opinion that it is best to take a trip in a group led by a tour guide . The reason is that I can get a sense of security when traveling in a group . For example , if I lose all of my money on the way to my travel by accident , I can ask somebody participating in the tour as well as the tour guide for help at any time . That is to say , in case of emergency , I do not have to worry about financial problems during my trip . Hence , I do believe it is much better and safer to take a trip in a gruop guided by a tour conductor . Second , I do feel that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is more affordable to take part in package tours as a group . Not only that , I can get more useful information about the places and sites which I am going to visit from the tour guide in more effecive ways . On the other hand , it is really tiresome and troublesome for me to make my study plans such as the duration of my travel , where to stay , and making a list of places to viist on my own .

"(GER) If I was asked some details on the exam , I wrote last week , I probably could n't remember a lot , although I spend quite an amount of time on preparation . Is n't that a hint for the necessarity of changing learning requirements and student education - In my opinion , the teaching of basic qualifications concerning the achievement and comprehension of knowledge and thinking is the more effective way to a fluent , highly adaptable intellectual ability . Being able to understand ideas and concepts is a capability which is required in nearly any kind of intellectual situation . To be capable of the most important tools in dealing with academic material which maybe catching the main idea of a text , summarizing basic points , understanding the intention of an author or speaker , etc. is the basis for any kind of apprenticeship . Unfortunately , this qualifications play a subordinate role compared to the learning of facts . Of course , facts are also of importance to be able to treat a certain topic , but without the ability to integrate single facts into one 's fluent knowledge , they wo n't last in mind for long time . Being able to use the basic tools for dealing with any kind of knowledge presented will strongly improve the ability to find out important facts if needed . Like one of my teachers told me `` you do n't need to keep any fact in mind , but you need to know where to find it if necessary '' , it is important to konow about sources and connections between them - which means their basic ideas - while dealing with any context of apprenticeship . As described above , I think , students should get familiar to understanding ideas and concepts , and even to develope their own ones , because this will allow them to deal with unknown information und contexts . As especially at an early age , the human brain is able to develope , it is very important to implement basic competencies of learning and thinking at that time .

"(SPA) `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' This is a statement many people from different age groups claim to be true . But I believe that this statement is not true . Young people can enjoy life , most of them do . But the problem nowadays is that all the young kids and young adults have a desire to grow faster and mature earlier in order to be allowed to do more things . As well , many of them take several things for granted , such as children 's games , situations and experiences that you only experience in your childhood . They believe that these situations such as climbing the tree or sleeping in a childrens ' house will always be there for them to take . So they desire to grow up earlier in order to do the things they watch in tv , such as having a girlfriend/boyfriend or going to college . This fake believe robs them from their true fun , which at their age should be table games , or play station . For example , my younger cousin who is 9 wants to grow up as soon as possible . Therefore , he has bought ( with his savings ) things that a grown up should have like a cellphone . This obsesion to mature has shifted him away of the true enjoyable situations a child should experience . As maturity comes in a time for everyone , adults know that their time on earth is limited . Thanks to their previous eagerness to grow up , they did not have the chance to experience all the situations life had to offer . Hence , this time , they will make time ( if they need to ) in order to enjoy themselves and live life to the fullest . Although as an adult , one has more responsabilities and concerns , everyone tries to make the time to relax and enjoy life . This desire for living life to the fullest together with the new oportunities they now have is what allows an adult to finally achieve the joy they 've always been looking for . As joy is something everyone always desires , they will try to repeat their fun everytime they can . Overall , the statement that claims that young people have more fun than older people is a fallacy due several facts . Firstly , younger people try to run past their childhood in order to reach adulthood and have more freedom . But at this time , they are losing every oportunity to enjoy thier lives .

If something new vehicle or machine invented in near future , people might change their way to move , but this invention must be more convenient and cheaper than cars .

Limiting the use of this kind of private transportation can help alot in mentaining a good balance in the usage of such energy sourses .

This one of the decession which might be taken by the society in the future as a solution to the predicted setuation of the future living . We all know that these cars consums energy to work . for today 's situation , the cars are using gas as a main sourse of energy to work , so the using of this kind of transportation is controled by the avaliable amount of this energy sourse . If the word is going to face the limitation of this sourses of energy , there will be some new decesions to control the consuming of gas on the trasportation . Limiting the use of this kind of private transportation can help alot in mentaining a good balance in the usage of such energy sourses . The population will be asked to use the public transportaion such as buses and traind . Another benefit of this decesion will help alot in reducing the traffic problems and the crowded streets . In some huge cities , the work places are spreaded every where . Second thing there are mostly sopping malls and supermarkets every where . If the future cities will be like that there will be no longer need for personal transportation because the places are nearby and the using of cars and personal cars will be worthless smld",ARA+TUR
"(ITA) I agree with the statement , I think that for the students is more important understand ideas and concepts , because when a person understand ideas ( he or she ) can applicate this in real life or can teach to ather people that concept . But I think also that for understand better ideas or concepts a person must learn facts , bacause facts rappresent a great example about ideas . At school students study a lot , for example , history because this subject is very important for understand a lot of today things from the past mistake . If you know the human history you can do the best choise , but a lot of students stady the history but sometime they ca n't understand the real meaning of things that they have just read on the book . For this reason , for me , it is very important learn ideas , because not all people can interpretate in the right way the facts . It is much faster study a fact then understend correctly concepts . The real problem about this learning metod is that there is n't a single way to interpretate facts , all people have a different mind and not always they give the right sense to things .

First of all being successful needs the ability of trying new things other than the usual . Trying new things and creating some ideas make the person to move upwards in his or her career . For example creators of the '' Youtube '' did something that has not done before .

People often stick with things that are good at , but trying new tehniques and using the oppurtunities to do something new and different , brings the success .

"(HIN) I disagree with the issue that a person should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject because of many reasons . First of all , like it is said that little knowldge is dangerous and harmful . When u know about a lot of subjects but a very little of each , you may probably mislead others because you are not aware of small n accurate information which can lead to a lot of problems . Secondly , when you know about the subject in and out , you can always deal with any problem that come across that issue . for example , if you have done a major in accounts in your college , then you can probably teach in the college or atleast help someone who is in need , because that person can trust you with the information because you are a testimony in that case . But if you have little knowledge of many subjects , then you cant be a testimony and people will not trust you for any information becuse you do not specialise in any subjects and moreover when you are a testimony because you have specialised in one subject , you get a broader aspect of getting a good job . but if you have a little knowledge of many subjects , you end up nowhere . for instance , a professor who is specialised in accounting can influence others with his achievements in his field . and can encourage others to follow one specific target in life because it leads to a brighter horizon . But when you are not sure abt your strengths , it leads you very doubtful becuse you are not sure of your capabilities .

In other words , claiming to have a read a book by reading its ' back cover . Limited knowledge of multiple topics is of no real use unless a person 's vocation requires him to possess such knowledge . Specialization on the other hand is what leads to pure genius .

India owes its present day nuclear status to these men who laid the foundation stone for the edifice of Indian Nucleardom .

"(HIN) I do agree to the fact that successful people do try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know . I do believe so because of the fact that options in life shouldnt be ruled down to only a few . People should try exploring new avenues and try out new things so as to master the very aspect called `` life '' . Evolution , adaptation focus is the name of the game . When a person who is ambitious and an optimist tries doing something innovative he usually strikes or achieves a place where in not many people have achieved in life . Today we thank people like Thomas Addison and James watt for their inventions . Such things never came to their mind in second or two . It took them loads of restless work and patience and teh ability to cope with failure again and again to give us what we relish or enjoy in todays world a telephone or a steam engine . A mans horizon of thinkin should be very wide open . He should be well versed with his idea and should carry the potential for acheivin what he thought of doin . he should have a vision in short . A strong vision is half victory . People like Bill Gates never hesitated to put their vision on paper and his hard work , dedication , aim has given us a beautiful product called microsoft which is used by every one . His job never ended after he gave us `` windows '' there were many other things that microsft had to give us and is still giving till date . U should try to be innovative in life trying to explore what all nature has to give us . Risks are usually involved but i believe in the saying `` no pain no gain '' everything comes at a price and u should be willing to pay a price . For example in India companies like reliance which practically run india where just a man 's vision . Ambani never ended his thirst for achieving till the time he passed away . They are till date trying to lay their hands on what all they can from clothes to elctricity to fuels to power the list is endless . According to me everybody lives in this world but if u want to create a mark or achieve something or have that satisfaction within , that '' I am different '' and want to be remembered u need to try out all what u can rather than just sticking on to one thing and try to make something out of it.

A mans horizon of thinkin should be very wide open . He should be well versed with his idea and should carry the potential for acheivin what he thought of doin . he should have a vision in short . A strong vision is half victory . People like Bill Gates never hesitated to put their vision on paper and his hard work , dedication , aim has given us a beautiful product called microsoft which is used by every one . His job never ended after he gave us `` windows '' there were many other things that microsft had to give us and is still giving till date . U should try to be innovative in life trying to explore what all nature has to give us . Risks are usually involved but i believe in the saying `` no pain no gain '' everything comes at a price and u should be willing to pay a price . For example in India companies like reliance which practically run india where just a man 's vision . Ambani never ended his thirst for achieving till the time he passed away . They are till date trying to lay their hands on what all they can from clothes to elctricity to fuels to power the list is endless . According to me everybody lives in this world but if u want to create a mark or achieve something or have that satisfaction within , that '' I am different '' and want to be remembered u need to try out all what u can rather than just sticking on to one thing and try to make something out of it. '' winners are not quitters '' . Life has kept a lot hidden there just needs to be a thirst for exploring new avenues and tryin out different things which can be only achieved by a good vision , aim and a very optimistic attitude .

"(SPA) I would have to say that I agree with the statement : `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and here is why : When you are young ( I would say under 35 ) you have more energy to go around , you definitively have less commitments and responsabilites ( family or work ) , than when you are old , ( over 35 ) you are more of a free spirit . Please allow me to explain my ideas with some examples . When I mean you have more energy to go aroung , I am talking about vitality and being in shape , it would not be as easy or comfortable to climb a mountain and camp outdoors when you are in your twenties , when your body is tone and strong . than when your are in your fifties even if you stay in shape , there is always the risk of a heart attack or other conditions that normally appear with age . And things that seemed okey before may be uncomfortable or even dangerous now . As for the commitments and responsabilites , I gravitate towards family and work . To me these two are the center of my life . I could not do the things I did in my twenties now that I have a family to support and I am tied with a mortgage and credit card bills . So I guess I would call this the `` settled life factor '' , which could be pretty tight in both spheres but more manageable when young . Finally , I belive that when you are young , you are more willing to take risks , go for adventures and take chances as you go . As people mature they some how change their ways , and settle for something secure which I would translate into a calm life , with much of the enjoyment used already or waiting to be `` used '' during vacation times , maybe once a year . And as I have heard people say : If I did n't do that when I was young I do n't think I could do it now .",SPA," I would have to say that I agree with the statement : `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and here is why : When you are young ( I would say under 35 ) you have more energy to go around , you definitively have less commitments and responsabilites ( family or work ) , than when you are old , ( over 35 ) you are more of a free spirit .

"(HIN) Learning should be based on ideas and concepts Mastering the ideas and concepts are essential part of learning . I completely believe that ideas and concepts is much more important for the students than just focusing on the facts . There are several reasons for this . First of all , understanding the ideas provides a stimulus to the brain and helps positive thinking , learning and mastering of the subject . With the concept being understood , one can apply these ideas to any similar situation . It is much easier to connect one idea to another and build a logical conclusion about a subject or theory . Secondly , understanding the facts also needs some ideas to fully grasp the knowledge of the subject . Without any idea or logical stream of thought behind , it will be very difficult even to understand why a fact actually happened . Focusing only on the fact and not looking at the underlying concept is like building something without a solid foundation . Understanding the concept behind a particular theory also allows to deal with unexpected situations in a better way . For example , if somebody know the concept behind a mathematical theory , one can easliy solve any problem without memorizing the contents or facts of the problem . Similarly understanding concepts of physics allows a person to apply the same principals to a variety of situations and provide useful explanations . Understanding the ideas & concepts also promotes further learning . It is easier to teach a subject to others if one has mastered the ideas and concepts behind it . Lastly , understanding the ideas and concepts helps the development of the subject itself . With the concepts fully understood , one can then build more useful ideas over them . These ideas then become part of the subject or theory itself and make the application of the theory to real life more useful .",HIN," Learning should be based on ideas and concepts Mastering the ideas and concepts are essential part of learning .

"(FRE) I do not agree with the proposed statement and I will give different examples showing that young people nowadays are not as selfish as presented . First of all , I must confess that there is a common image of young people depicting them as more and more selfish , only worrying about themselves , playing on their computer and waiting for the diner to be ready . This picture is usually compared to the one presenting young people some decades ago , helping their parents at the shop , in the field or simply at home . However , my opinion is that this selfish image is too limited . More and more young people spend time and efforts in social organisations . For instance , the number of boy scouts in Belgium is increasing . Scouting is typically a place where people learn to care for their communities . They organise activities to help homelesses , they help at the church and take part in social events . Another example is the social work which is more and more proposed by schools to students . Students are proposed to work for social organisations during a definite period of time . These social works are more and more popular , showing that young people are ready to give time to their communities , as soon as they receive the opportunity to do it . Furthermore , there are plenty of young people that each year leave their country during summer holidays to go and help other communities in need . Some are going to build schools in Africa , others entertain small children in Asia , ... This shows that young people nowadays care not only about their community but are also ready to spend time and money ( they usually pay their fight ticket ) to go and meet other communities that need their help .

"(FRE) I do not really agree with this statement saying that in twenty years the number of cars would have decreased . That does not mean that I object to the goal of reducing the number of cars in the world ; of course , this is a necessary evolution and industrialized and rich countries are currently trying to follow this path . For instance , in Paris , the mayor tries for years to prevent people from taking their cars by making the circulation very difficult and by encouraging the creation of new bus lines . He also promotes bikes , having created new roads that can only be used by them . I consider all theses actions as positive actions : it shows that people are eventually aware of the urgency of a change in our attitude towards pollution . We are responsible for the world we are leaving to the next generations and we can no longer live as we do now ( using so many resources ) . But , what seems to contradicts this movement towards a decrease in cars in use , is the situation in developping countries : we can study the case of China . As a matter of fact , China is getting more and more powerful and is now going through this period of industrialization that western countries already experienced a century ago . A part of the Chinese population is getting richer and richer and can now afford cars . So when a country of more than one billion inhabitants gets access to car markets , we can imagine that in the years to come , the number of cars is not really going to dwindle . But what can we say ? Can we deny them the right to get a car ? to consume after years of being deprived and seeing how it was in western countries ? After all , we did the same before , as we were not concerned about the environmental issue ... In conclusion , I would say that it is a really difficult question to forsee whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years . But it is a tendency that we have to further , especially in poorer countries , by explaining how necessary it is and maybe helping them financially to build public infrastructures that could replace the use of cars .",FRE," I do not really agree with this statement saying that in twenty years the number of cars would have decreased .

"(SPA) That young people enjoy life more than older people is relative of each person . For me a 25 student trying to achieve many things as a good job or high steem reputation the life some times could be stressfull , but it is important to keep a balance between what i want and what i need . Some times the older people have enough benefits to enjoy the rest of their lifes . Of course they worked for all their lifes , and right now have the money to spend travelling or living in quiet places where they can rest in peace , but what about those with out the benefits ; In contrast there are old people around the word without money or benefits of any kind . They sometimes have to go to the streets asking for cents so they can live . In this case it would be impossible to get a good quality of life . On the other hand , the young people have all the chances in front of them . they can live their lifes as they want , sometime rushing in new things without thinking the consecuences . Others young people are more concerns about build a reputation and have good jobs and that kind of life make them happy . I think that all depends of what the people want for themself .

"(HIN) Young people surely enjoy life more than older people do . There are various reasons to support this opinion . Firstly , young people have more energy and vitality than older people who may suffer from various ailments and may become less physically active as they age . Youth , with all its energy provides a chance for various adventures and possibilties . This may be one of the reasons why younger people outnumber older ones in adventure sports and other thrilling and sometimes potentially dangerous fun activites . Secondly , younger people may have lesser responsibilties than their older counterparts because of absence of dependents like spouse and children . Hence they dont need to take many factors into account or compromise when doing or pursuing an activity or vocation of their choice . Thirdly , young people have more opportunities and less obligations and are more inclined to venture into unexplored areas and innovate . They may be ready to take calculated risks if it helps in their growth and advancement . Though this may sound as being less responsible , but a person only grows when he moves out of his comfort zone . Also , older people may be less flexible and less open to change even if it is for their own good . While young people are open to new ideas and willing to try them .

"(FRE) I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . There are many reasons that justify this fact . Most young people are robust and full of energy and this gives them an advantage over old people . Enjoying life means that one can be able to do all that he or she feels like doing at any time without any restrictions for example taking part in a sporting activity , travelling , spending time with friends . Most of these activities require one to be physically fit . Young people do not have the same responsibilities as old people do so this will give them more chances of enjoying life for example old people have to be careful how they spend their money because they have a number of things to pay for ; electricity bills , morgage , their children 's education ... but young people who still live with their parents have no bills to pay so whatever money they earn is directed in paying for fun trips , fancy mobile phones and the like . Another factor that justifies the above statement is that young people are more outgoing than old people do . For example young people are very willing to take part in new adventures that old people wont be very much at ease to do for example skating or parachute jumping or even motorbike racing . Olp people will consider such activities as dangerous whereas young people will see these activities as a big thrill . Companies that produce musical gadgets like walkmans , Compact disc players , MP3s consider the young people as their biggest customers so they model these gadgets in a way that only young people can use them easily and thus such technonological advancements dont favour old people making young people enjoy life more than old people .

Recently there was a proposal for reservation of seats in leading educational institutions for few sections of the community in India . Lots of young people opposed to this law . There were protests in several cities against this law . I also took part in a protest in the city I lived . We protested by carryout a peaceful rally in the city . In all these protests it was observed that the majority of the protesters were young people in the age group of 20 to 25 . It is intersting to note that these young people donot gain anything from this protest but they knew that the law would kill the merit and affect the next generation of students . This was their was of helping the community and they were successful at it .

"(ITA) As we move further in the new era of technology , the world of advertisment is crutial in proposing new products to the masses so as to increase their demand on the market . However , as time has gone on the world of advertising has stopped being a method to promote and has developed as a commercial industry ready to do anything in order to make a product more appealing . A possible justification to this phenomena is the `` fashion '' behind each advertisment . Often do we buy a product because of its appealing advertisment rather than its content . This is due to the popular fame that some products achieve through their advertisment , especially within the teenage population . As a young adult , I can see the onspread of this tendency when speaking with fellow friends and affronting the argument of wether a type of clothing is fancy or not just because of the advertisment behind it . I also think that advertisment has taken on this role because of the advancing of technology , such as Television or On line pop ups , which effectivly keep on promoting products . It is because of this increased supply in ways to advertise that advertisment has taken on another role and does not limit itself to selling a product but tries to make it seem much better than it truly is . This ties in with the next concept : better technologies , such as TV animations , have induced companies in portraying products such as food as more tasty just through their advertisment . How often have we seen a pizza look more tasty on TV than on our real life kitchen table ? Why not consider the increase in advertisments as more appealing than the actual product as a result of the same availability of a particular product ? For example , an expnential increase in cellular phones has requested companies to portray each cell phone as more useful , technological and handy then it actually is because of the competition that can be found in the mobile sector . Thus , when we look at a newspaper ad or watch a TV commercial , I think we must take concius action to question the actual product that is trying to be sold to us at all costs , and refer to the item itself before purchasing it .",ITA," As we move further in the new era of technology , the world of advertisment is crutial in proposing new products to the masses so as to increase their demand on the market . However , as time has gone on the world of advertising has stopped being a method to promote and has developed as a commercial industry ready to do anything in order to make a product more appealing . A possible justification to this phenomena is the `` fashion '' behind each advertisment . Often do we buy a product because of its appealing advertisment rather than its content . This is due to the popular fame that some products achieve through their advertisment , especially within the teenage population .

"(GER) Christopher Columbus was the first European to discover the continent America . He was an explorer . I thinkt it is quite evident to everybody that in order to reach his aims he had to take a lot of risks and finally , although America is not India , he succeeded . But is it always necessary to take risks in order to be a successful person . With regard to this question the first thing to come into my mind is that there are actually a lot of people who are highly successful without ever taking much risk in their lifes . I am talking about people who have a pleasant childhood , who have nice parents that are aware of their responsibilty of being parents . Parents who care about the education of their children . Mostly those children have fewer problems at school which means they have better marks and therefore are allowed to study on well-reputated universities and finally become for example high-paid businessmen . They never take much risk and still become successful . Moreover I am not sure if it would not be better to focus on your strengths . Michael Porter for instance affirmed , that companies should rather focus on their competencies instead of trying to enhance their weaknesses . In my view that is applicable for human-beings . You probably could be much more successful if you try to enhance your already existing skills than to start to learn new skills , and of course that is less risky . But on the other hand there is no denying the fact that there are numerous examples , like Kolumbus , which proof that a certain amount of risk is a premise for success . That for example can easily on the stock market . The stocks that yield the highest profit are also those which can cost you a lot of money - they are highly risky . And of course the exmaple of the businessmen is only some kind of a stereotype . Often one has to make difficult decisions in order to reach one | 's aims in the working life . Decisions always equals potential risk . Suppose you get a challenging high-paid job offer in Asia . Then you could jump on it taking the risk of going into a new country and being exposed to strange and maybe unkind people or you could deny it and stay in your homecountry earning an average amount of money leading a normal life .

"(GER) This essay tries to provide a closer look to the question if successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . To start with a variation of a common place : There are usually many different roads to success in a variety of fields like life , work , and business , to name the most popular ones . When being young , people tend to explore themselves and their surroundings by ways different from the others . Even if they are not trying new things , they imagine themselves as being different from the older ones . For young people , this imagination can be a strong drive for achievement and enables them to take risks . These could support them in the end up to be more successful than others . Nevertheless , success always depends not just on oneselve but on a couple of features and factors , for example , the actings of others , I believe . The lonesome cowboy who is just doing things his way and being successful by doing so belongs rather to the realm of dream than to everyday reality . Adapting to the given circumstances by living in a human surrounding means to learn , to understand and to be influenced by the way other people handle things . Moreover , human interaction and therefore the handling of everyday includes the idea of being organized in systems . Outstanding or non-fitting elements can be excepted and exist only for a limited time before becoming unbearable . If one knows to handle things in a successful way suiting the social and natural environment , one surely can be successful by sticking to a particular approach for a long time . The Coca Cola Company is one of the best examples for people who know how to do well because they stick to the basic recepy of the beverage known as Coca Cola . At the same time Coca Cola tries to do new things and takes risks by mixing new tasts and flavours . So success always is a mixture of both , I believe : to learn from others how to do things well and to try new things and take risks . Sometimes it is wise to tend a bit more to the one aspect and then there are times to lean to the other side - just like Goethe said : Known things and ways have to be preserved in order to see and understand new things and ways .",GER," This essay tries to provide a closer look to the question if successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

"(CHI) Will we have more cars in the future or not ? This is a questions that many people would like to find out whether they are car producers , environmentalists , or just regular people who either taking public transportation or owning a car . However , I think it is important to address that different parts of the world might have different results . It is because people in different places give different cultural meanigns of the cars and they might have different priority in relation to what is imporatnt to them as a group . I will start by pointing out how different places preceive cars in some ways and how these differences might increase or decrease cars in the future . First , in some developing countries , such as China , car is a symbol of modernity and wealth . When this connection is formed and built , it is quite difficult to expect that poeple will decrease cars in use within twenty 20 years since what people desire is development . And , this image of developement happend to also means `` having cars . '' In this sense , I think it is quite unrealisitic to agree that people will diminish the amount fo cars . After all , the major goal of these places is economic development and decreasing the ownership of cars contracdicts to their major goal . On the other hand , for some places in the world , especially countries in the West , the meaning of cars and the prority of what is imporant to them are different . To them , car is more or less merely a tool . Although I do realize that some people in the West aslo use car as a symbol of prestige , there is a degree difference in relation to how stronger that a car is tied with the concept of modernity . Meanwhile , peopel in teh West might think the envirnment protection is at least as important as development , if it is not more important . In this sense , when cars do not carry such strong desire of being modern , meanwhile the idea of environmentialism is appreciated , it is more likely that there will be less cars in the nearly future . Therefore , I think teh amount of cars will decrase in some areas in the world meanwhile decrease in other areas depends on different context and the symbolic meanings of cars in different cultures . I think it is problematic to make a universal statment on this issues .",CHI," Will we have more cars in the future or not ?

And , this image of developement happend to also means `` having cars . '' In this sense , I think it is quite unrealisitic to agree that people will diminish the amount fo cars . After all , the major goal of these places is economic development and decreasing the ownership of cars contracdicts to their major goal . On the other hand , for some places in the world , especially countries in the West , the meaning of cars and the prority of what is imporant to them are different . To them , car is more or less merely a tool . Although I do realize that some people in the West aslo use car as a symbol of prestige , there is a degree difference in relation to how stronger that a car is tied with the concept of modernity . Meanwhile , peopel in teh West might think the envirnment protection is at least as important as development , if it is not more important . In this sense , when cars do not carry such strong desire of being modern , meanwhile the idea of environmentialism is appreciated , it is more likely that there will be less cars in the nearly future . Therefore , I think teh amount of cars will decrase in some areas in the world meanwhile decrease in other areas depends on different context and the symbolic meanings of cars in different cultures . I think it is problematic to make a universal statment on this issues .",KOR+CHI+JPN
"(KOR) I do not agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that today because people have been having the desire of having their own car to have convieint life and in 20 years , the price of the cars will be lower . First , in 20 years , there will be even more cars than today . Out economy and the state of living conditon have been better and better . These days , people generally do not need to worry about food , place to live and clothes . Nowadays , it is the problem of choosing so many options to enhence out life . Since we live in a great life , we want to have more comfortable and easy life . There was an interesting article of driving a car instead of using pubblic transportation . The article says even if people know that the rush hour is painful , they prefer to drive their own car because it is simple to go out and go to the place where they want . Second , it will be easier to buy cars in the future . The things that were used to be very expesive so we could not buy well are getting cheaper and cheaper . For instance , buying a computer or a car costed a leg or an arm about 30 and 40 years ago . Even buying a computer this year is cheaper than last year .

That is why cars are also cheaper day by day so as in twenty years , people can get cars more easily than now therefore , if people have cars , they will use them more than now .

"(TEL) I strongly agree that `` young people enjoy life more than than older people do '' for whole lot of reasons . First of all people at young age are not bothered about any responsibilities . They are free birds and they like to enjoy their life to fullest . For example right now I an doing my graduation and I am not at all bothered about anything , I enjoy a lot with my friends , go for parties , have get togethers , we watch lot of movies . I never think about future , I like to take the life as it comes . Whereas when I see my parents they are lot more concerned about different issues in life , like they are bothered about their life after retirement , or the burden of their kids . The next thing is people at young age try to be adventerous , innovative in their thoughts and ideas . They try out some thing or the other to keep their life intresting . They expect some kind of thrill in their life . Whereas the elder people doesnot want to try out new things and they prefer to spend a stable and peaceful life . People at young age are very healthy compared to the elder people . They are with full vigor . The health problems of elderly may keep them away from enjoying the life to the fullest .

Our present society allows us the freedam of value . Whether enjoying life in the former part of the life or in the latter part basically depends on each person 's judgement about value . There is no predominant notion that young people have to serve for the nation nor people have to enjoy their life when they are young . The general statement that youg people enjoy life more than older people might apply to some , but never applies to all the persons . For me , I think it desirable to enjoy life equally both in the former part of my life and the latter in a different way . On this point , I will explain later in this essay . Second reason is that our lifespan has extended very much compared to the past era . In the past , it might be beneficial to enjoy much during the youth time because it was difficult to enjoy life in the latter part of life owning to the disease and the limited life time . Now average lifespan is over seventies for male and eities for female . After the retirement , we can enjoy a plenty of free time . They can also use their experience to enjoy life better . As for the second reason , opponents might argue that young people also have the advantages for enjoying life . For example , young people have the advantage in the phyisicalness .

"(GER) To answering this question in an adequate way we need to analyse why society use cars . Based on this considerations we can try to figure out if there would be less cars than today . The history about the cars began last century . Cars increased and are still increasing our mobility . I belive that there are to different mobilities : the personal and the economical mobility . The personal mobility is something people want to have . It allows us to move from one point to an other point at the time we would like to . We do n't need to have a look on schedules . We are independent from others . To give up this personal freedom is hardly conceivable . On the other hand , cars are so important for the world wide economy .

"(JPN) There are , indeed , a vast number of ways to succeed in life .

Although all the ways of becoming successful in life mentioned previously may seem reasonable , I believe that the genuine successful people try new , unique things that no one else has ever done in history , and this can be supported by using the example of some sports , and how some new ideas can influence the success of the team in its entirety . Firstly , doing what people already know how to do well means that it lacks in originality and uniquness . This implies that what people are doing is not only familiar to the people who are using the method , but also to the people around them . It is possible to enhance the understanding of this point of view with an example of a soccer game and strategies that the coach uses in order to win a game . If the coach decides to use the strategy that he or she knows well , it implies that the other soccer teams would know how the players are going to approach the game , meaning that it would make the players on the opponent team easier to predict the actions that the players are going to take . This proposes that there is less chance of succeeding for the team that is using the familiar strategy to win .

Clearely , some of these activities ca n't be done by older people mainly for physical reasons . But on the other hand , there are still many activities remaining that are even more suitable to be done by older people : First of all , there are characteristic ways to engage in sports for older people , like hiking , swimming and playing golf and chess .

Second , there are a lot of opportunities to meet other people in several clubs or on bus tours . In these occassions they may even meet people that share the same interests .

First of all , because a person who plans the advertisement is the person who wants to sell the goods , the advertisement follows the seller 's intention .

Hence , although the impression that advertise makes is not exactly same as that of the product , the customer has no way to figure out the fact .

As a result , the sellers need to point out all the strong points of the product and express those under the limited condition . Due to this limitation , the seller would not present the unbeneficial sides of the product on the advertisement . On the other hand , the customer can accept only the shown aspects on the advertisement and loses opportunity to evaluate the goods in various views . In addition , the skills that are used in the advertisement affect on the impression that customer receives .

First of all , when you get to travel in a group , you always have to move with the group , which means you ca n't schedule your own course where you want to drop by during your trip . You might go to only the places which you did n't expected to go . For example , I was on a trip to Japan . Me and my friend scheduled everyplace we wanted to visit for 2 weeks . It taked a bit of time to get those imformation but it was worth it . Suppose I travel in a group with a tour guide and miss the premiere leage , the English soccer leage , eventhough I 'm travelling England becuase it 's mot scheduled . That will be terrible for me . Secondly , if there is a tour guide he might tell you all the imformation about all the places and stuff . It could be good for some people but I think studying about places you go , cultures neer it , learning history is all part of the trip .

"(HIN) The statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one subject is an controversial one and I would describe the reasons why . The statement actually begs the question and is an overstatement at best . One must have a stronghold over one subject , and not just ` broad knowledge ' and additionally , one should be aware of the happenings in other streams . The speaker 's claim that one must have information of many subjects is problemetic at best . The speaker fails to give a number for ` many ' here . However , I believe that any sincere student must have information over related subjects . For example , a student of food technology must be an informd student of biology , chemistry , biochemistry and engineering too . But his core stream will be food technology and its related subjects . Thus , the speaker 's claim of speacialising in one subject is unjustifiable since the student may know about related subjects in more detail than just having broad information . The student specialising in a subject is expected to know in detail about the subject . For example , a student studying medicine is expected to be proficient in not just ready with the information but also to be able to practice it as and when needed . This comes through continuous hard work and devotion to one 's chosen field of study . If the student tries to indulge in other academic disciplines too much , he will harm the pateints and his own career . Thus one has to be cautious about studying other subjects . Studying many subjects , will make the student a mere dabbler who risks hampering furture growth . Additionally the student is expected to have some inclination for arts and its various forms , political science , finance for these subjects help the student to go ahead with life with ease and to understand the significance of events efecting him . Thus , the speaker 's claim about knowing only one subject is also not sufficient . Thus , both the scenarios - of having some knowledge about all the subjects and knowing everything about just one subject - should be discouraged . With the world becoming a smaller place and universities offering a host of admixed streams and choices to students , these are actually not even possible in today 's scenario . A student should study hard at his chosen field of study and also , as he can devote time , try to learn other related and unrelated subjects but not at the cost of his subject .",HIN," The statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one subject is an controversial one and I would describe the reasons why .

The speaker 's claim that one must have information of many subjects is problemetic at best . The speaker fails to give a number for ` many ' here . However , I believe that any sincere student must have information over related subjects . For example , a student of food technology must be an informd student of biology , chemistry , biochemistry and engineering too . But his core stream will be food technology and its related subjects . Thus , the speaker 's claim of speacialising in one subject is unjustifiable since the student may know about related subjects in more detail than just having broad information . The student specialising in a subject is expected to know in detail about the subject . For example , a student studying medicine is expected to be proficient in not just ready with the information but also to be able to practice it as and when needed . This comes through continuous hard work and devotion to one 's chosen field of study . If the student tries to indulge in other academic disciplines too much , he will harm the pateints and his own career . Thus one has to be cautious about studying other subjects . Studying many subjects , will make the student a mere dabbler who risks hampering furture growth . Additionally the student is expected to have some inclination for arts and its various forms , political science , finance for these subjects help the student to go ahead with life with ease and to understand the significance of events efecting him . Thus , the speaker 's claim about knowing only one subject is also not sufficient . Thus , both the scenarios - of having some knowledge about all the subjects and knowing everything about just one subject - should be discouraged . With the world becoming a smaller place and universities offering a host of admixed streams and choices to students , these are actually not even possible in today 's scenario . A student should study hard at his chosen field of study and also , as he can devote time , try to learn other related and unrelated subjects but not at the cost of his subject .",HIN+TEL
"(HIN) Basic education in school covers a wide range of subjects . Schools try to impart broad knowledge of many subjects to students . However , after graduation , a person has to take up a particular role in an organization or society . In order to perform his role effectively he needs to specialize in his job . I believe that foucs on specialization is very important in today 's world . People contribute to the society in different ways . Some people produce grains while others defend the society . The social system makes sure that people cooperate with each other and everyone takes up different responsibilities . This division of work leads to a more prosperous society . Hence people need to choose their specialization and make their contribution to society . Some activities , like research , need specialists . If someone is planning to undertake reseach , he needs to devote a lot of time to his topic of reseach . Today 's world is very complex . He will be more productive is all his energy and plans are focussed in one area . In conclusion , I believe that specialization is very beneficial to society .

In addition , I will not reveal the number of old peolple that told me that I was lucky to be young as if they were suffering from their life .

However , beyond these appearances , I feel that young people do not enjoy life more than older people do . First and foremost , young people are not as happy as others could think .

For example , last year , thousands of French students demonstrated in the streets to blame the government for not taking seriously into account the dramatic unemployment for young people .

"(GER) In my opinion , success is mainly the result of realized chances and opportunities . As a consequence , I agree with the issued statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . I do acknowledge that there may be situations in which it may prove better to stick to what you are used to do . In the course of a sports examination , for example , it may not be too wise to try an entirely new way of jumping across a hurdle . However , even in a situation like this the basic fact remains valid that without taking some risk you may miss your chances . In my example this means that this one different jump might just have been the one your teacher wanted to see . Apart from that , I believe that you ca n't make any progress if you stay persistently at the same level . And always doing what you know how to well already does n't mean anything else but precisely this remaining static and without progress . In order to be successful , it is , in my opinion , essential that you make some progress . For usually success is connected with some achievement . This is just another reason why I agree with the issued statement . However , the most important reason , why I affirm this statement , is that chances may appear suddenly .

For example , when I was a attending classes at university , I always tried to pay more attention to the main ideas the professor was trying to explain , which does not mean that I found facts less important , but in my case , I knew that in order to understand and facilitate my studying for an exam , it would better if I could develop the topic thinking in a different way and not just memorizing each word he said or each fact stated . Nevertheless , facts would help me have more specific details about the class but if I have just learned facts or be more interested in them than in concepts probably I would forget those facts faster and may have more problems in answering questions that were not asked during the class because I did not understand what the main idea was about or what the professor was trying to teach us . Another important example why I am convinced ideas and concepts worth more than facts is related with the way we understand how a singular topic in real life is being developed .

"(JPN) Do you want to enjoy your life ? There is many ways of enjoying your life . What I think of enjoying a life is to be fun , and proud of what you are doing at all time .

For example , I would go shopping and hang out with my friends . I believe that is what most of young people would do . Talk with friends , doing what you want to do . Although does this have to be young people ? The answer is no . Older people can also go shopping and hang out with their friends . There is no such things that young people can do and the older can not . Older people have more experience to many things . Therefore they can always challenge themselves to do something harder . This gives the guts to do and overcome what they had done before . They also can do the things that they had done long ago and feel like they are young again .

"(TEL) I do agree with the statement that the number of cars would reduce in years to come and they will be fewer than the present in twenty years from now , but restricting to the developed countries . The number would be on the rise in developing and poor countries . In the developed countries that are already at a stage where there is a car for every individual ( adult ) and the pollution and traffic is at their peak there would be awareness about the vehicular pollution and trafic discomfort that leads to citizens opting to other cost effective and environmental freiendly modes of transort like the public transport system , Metros , busses etc. that will surely reduce the use of the personal cars . The information technology , boom in computer technology all these lead to reduction in the movement of men , where the works can be finished directing from one place . All these events might result in the usage of fewer number of cars and effective transport system in twenty years from now . But this is not the case with other part of the world , the poorer countries the developing countries where the possession of car is synonymous with high social status and the personal vehicle is still a luxary . for example if in the developed countries ther is a car in every home then in other countries with far more greater population there would be a car in every 10 homes . this is very much true atleast in countries like india . In such countries there will be a big boost in the number of cars owned by the individuals and it will then peaks in the tweny years from now .

"(HIN) The young generation of today is part of global world which is evolving very fast and has become very demanding for all the people who are an intergral part of it . The life of today embraces only those things which can help people to run faster in their life to achieve their sky high ambitions . Thus to say that the young people of today 's world do not have enough time to slow their life and take out some time for helping their community is not an overstatement . First , the global mantra of modern world is to get the best of everything in every sphere of life to be able to become very successful . What this results in is an inner drive in all the young people to go to the best school , best college and then get the most paying jobs . However , this does not mean that these young people do not spend some time with other people around them and help them . But the community service mostly done today is done to get some good voluntary work on their resume to be able to make it to best college . Second , i feel that there is lot of pressure on these young people to perform the best . This pressure includes both peer pressure at workplace or place of study and also social pressure in the society which does not recognize people unless they are on top of every activity . This increased pressure has resulted in young people becoming part of only those groups which include people who have similar goals and aspirations . As a result , these young people feel that is it waste of time by doing something like community service on regular basis that does not promte their own ambitions . Finally , i feel that the work load of all young people has increased . The school work hardly result in any time for these young minds to take out some time even for their parents . The extra long working hours of the wokplace also ensure that people are out of house for most part of day all week . My example is most suited for such situation cause I spend atleast fifteen hours daily for six days in week at my job place and there are times when i do not get a chance to even talk to my parents for weeks in row . The one off hoilday here and there is spent by me with my friends . Thus very little time remains with me to be able to do some help to other people . However , there are still certain examples today of people who have left colleges and their well paying jobs to start some venture to help their community , The example of a famour NRI is inspiration for all who left his multi million dollars job to start micro finance project in rural India which has become the first and biggest organisation of such kind . There are other examples too where young college students have gone to rural areas to teach the farmers and help them to manage their business . These students have formed a NGO in Delhi which has affiliation from more than 10,000 students all over India and are involved in giving reaching classes in 35 villages in 5 states in India .

Secondly , I agree that student must know every concepts of life because this is going to give them the power to solve new challegens without knowing the fact .

Famouse person like actors and sports star use the product and persuade the people to use the product in the advertisement . This type of advertisement make the image that the product is good because famous person use the product . The advertisement misleads someone to buy the prodcut even though the quality of the product is not good . In conclusion , the advertisments make people to buy product more if the advertisement does not exist . The advertisement give the information of the product , but because the purpose of the advertisement is not only giving the information but also persuading the people to buy the product , thd advertisements definitely exaggerate the quality of the product and makes the some image that differ from the real product .",KOR+CHI+JPN

"(CHI) Nowadays , whether young people enjoy life more than older people do is a prevalent topic which has been widly debated . Two different views exist to support or oppose . After considering several aspects , I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more . First of all , yong people have a strong study ability to learn new things around them . For example , computer is a new technology product in nowadays , young people prefer to go on line for fun , buying things on internet and making friends on it . Because they think it may save a lot of time and money . However , the oler people may prefer to live in a traditional way , since they do n't want to change their life style after living under the same one for ten or twenty years . That 's why they do n't want to taste the new things , though they are good . Second , young people have much more energy than older people have . The young people may often go to climb mountains and make a hike with their friends to see the beautiful flowers , blue sky and green sea . And after a long walk or traveling , they may recover quickly and go on with another adventure . By contrast , the older people do n't have this advantage . Since they are old , their phisycial condition is not as well as used to be . They can just stay at home to watch TV or have fun near where they live . Therefore , older people 's life is limited . Last but not least , the young people are much more creative . When they see something new or interesting , they may think of a lot of question related , such as why it is so cute or how they make it . After considering about these questiones , they may go to liberay and disscus with the friends for more details , and then they will try to improve it , create a better one . The young people enjoy thinking new things . But the older people may not be so active , because they have a lot of experiences . They may judge things according to their experience and compare the question with the situation that they familiar with .

"(TUR) Cars are the most convenient and usable transportations in the world . Also , almost every people have car for transportation and for their hobbies , too . Therefore , I think that in twenty years usage of cars will increase in order to decrease . First of all , cars have variety of usage areas for every kind of transportation facilities . Day by day , population of the world increases parallel to the consumption of cars . Many people need cars for private voyage from their homes to their jobs or for their holidays . In addition , some people - especially young people - have passion to modify their cars . It seems to me that cars are the toys of young generation . Secondly , many people afraid of travelling by plane or by ships in the oceans . For example ; the most famous artist in Turkey , who is Kemal Sunal , always used car becuse he is always afraid of air plane . He made film in the Pyramids and he had travelled from Istanbul to Pyramids by car . Therefore , cars are the first , unique and remarkable choice for them . Thirdly , car is the cheapest transportation in many countries . Around the world , a lot of people go other cities or countries for holidays , trips and for jobs . They always consider the most suitable way for the transportation . As the technology improving , cars will become more comfortable and cheaper . In conclusion , in the future there will be more cars in use than today .

Because of the concern of these organisations and many individuals and under the advise of many , many scientist some world leaders are engaged in this fighting , trying to avoid the world temperature to grow too much and attain certain levels . One of the consequences is that governments are trying to promote the common transport . For everyone having a car becomes more and more difficult . You have to pay a great deal of money to get your car insurance , you have to pay for parking in the streets of many towns all around the world ( London , Madrid , Paris ... ) ... Another important point is the decrease of world oil reserves . The experts calculate that in about a hundred or two hundred years oil reserves will almost dissapear . A lot of studies are being conducted to try to find a material to sustitute oil . The findings are really amazing but for the moment they didn ' t find an appropriate substitute . Well they tell us so . Many people think that there must be many substitutes for oil but that oil and car companies does not want to promote these ones because of the money .

"(ITA) In my opinion the most important thing for a student is not to learn facts , even though it should be useful , but to understand ideas and concepts . When somebody try to learn a fact he can do a lot of things in a wrong way : for instance he can forget it after few years , or he can also alter some essential parts of it . The result is to change the fact and alter completely the meaning of the information received . This can led to problems of understanding and , in the worsen cases , to bigger crisis .

When somebody try to learn a fact he can do a lot of things in a wrong way : for instance he can forget it after few years , or he can also alter some essential parts of it . The result is to change the fact and alter completely the meaning of the information received . This can led to problems of understanding and , in the worsen cases , to bigger crisis .

Let 's study it , explaining in a first part , why the younger should enjoy their life more than older people , in a second part , the contrary . First , young people are without doubt in a better health condition . It does a lot of job . Health is an important part of a happyness . When you get older , you become ill more often , and you have stronger weakness against diseases . Practising a sport is a real pleasure when you are able to do it . When we are under the age of 10 , we have no regrets ' thoughts when doing something , it is a real chance . And it is also the moment of many first-times , when you discover the world you live in . We all can remember amazing moments in our life that will stay written in our memory , due to the pleasure encountered . Why the older people would enjoy their life more than young people ? They have the knowledge . It helps having fun , when you know how to laugh about a subject or a situation . You better know how to satisfy yourself and your friends , because you got an entire life of experience . Then , I suppose there is the family : it is very enjoyable to see the babies of our own children , during the holidays for example . In some countries , old people do not work , they have all days to make what they want ; it is a kind of liberty . In a nutshell , I would say life is enjoyable wether you are young or old . Age is not that important , but the kind of situation that makes you satisfied change with the time . To my mind , people should take profit of each moment in a lifetime . It is the only key of a great life .",FRE," There are many ways to study this subject .

"(KOR) Recently , I am questioning myself in what age will I be able to enjoy my life . As a 23 year old university student , I came to the conclusion that older people enjoy life more than younger people . Some people would think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do because they are young . However , the real enjoyment of life cannot come in a young age . First of all , young people do not have enough achievements and experience to enjoy life . This may will sound strange to some people but in my opinion , to enjoy life , people have to have some kind of accomplishments . I consider enjoyment as an in-depth pleasure that comes out of achivements a person has made and from occurances that a person has experienced . Partying all nights would not be considered as the real enjoyment of life . It can be a short time enjoyment but not in a long run . For example , this winter I met some old couples who have retired from their work when I was in Cancun , which is a city in Mexico . I could not forget the happy faces . I had some chances to talk to them and what I was told that they just started to enjoy their life which seemed hard to understand to me . What they were saying was that when they were young , they had so many things to worry , about the promotion in their work , their sons and daughters and so on . But now they know how to enjoy their life without worrying about the thinks that was considered to be important in their past . Secondly , young people do not have much composure in mind to enjoy life . Young people who are mostly considered students have to work and study days and nights for their future . They do not have enought time to look back and spend much time on their hobbies . But as people get older , people tend to spend more time for their own . There is somehting that my mother always says to me when I am slacking off . `` To enjoy your life when you get older , you have to sacrifice your youth . '' To conclude , even though it is hard to say that older people do enjoy life more than the younger people because there is not an exact boundary between old and young , I strongly believe that older people know how to enjoy their life because they have more achievements and experiences than the youngers have . To enjoy my life when I get older , I am working hard to build up a bright future .

If you take this and think of the economic plans of the automobile coorperations to steadily increase the selling numbers by introducing their products on new markets like china or africa it becomes pretty hard to believe , the number will reduce over the next 20 years .

"(TEL) Multidisciplinary knowledge always helpful in professional and academic world . But , this is not always helpful in all the cases specifically in academics . Specialization in a specific subject is very important in the context of science and technology , where the research is a major point of interest . Without the specialization it is not possible to built the technological society , in which we are living now and which has been built by efforts of many scietists . Hence , I disagree with statement which is focusing on broad knowledge of many academic subjects . If we consider the broad knowledge in many subjects then the student will not be informed completely about any subject . So , he had very brief knowledge in all the subjects and he will become a generalists in the context of academics .

"(KOR) Is the best way to travel is going on a trip in a group led by a tour guide ? If you are asking my opinion , my answer would be No . I have experienced both travelling by myself and travelling with a tour guide , and , now , I will give you a couple of reasons why you should travel alone . First of all , when you travel by yourself , you will have all the freedom in the world during your travel . I am not talking about walking down the streets by yourself kind of freedom , what I am talking about is freedom to choose what to do , where to go , and what to eat , see , or experience . I am sure the tour guide will provide you an excellent tour course for you to enjoy with your group . However , tour course will be just that , the tour course . Hundreds , or maybe thousands of people may have already been to those places . Is that what you want ? Enjoying an experience that the rest of the world already know ? If I were you , I would love to go some places that no one has gone before , or the places that the locals enjoy , not the tourists enjoy . Maybe , you will be able to find and make a local friend while you are enjoying a meal that are popular amongst locals . Would that be possible if you were a member of a group who are follwoing the tail of the tour guide ? Also , how can you guarantee that you will be a member of a group consist of only nice and charming guys and girls ? You will be stuck with these people for a week or even for a month , what if some of them are just unpleasant people ? Let 's say you are sharing a room with one of your group members , what if he snores like thunder ? I am pretty sure that is not going to be a pleasant travelling moment . If you travel alone , you wo n't have to worry about any of that . Yes , you might feel lonely , you might need someone to depend on during your travel , but is n't that what the travel is all about ? If you did not want to feel lonely and be supported by your friends , you could have just stayed at your home ! People always look for easier and more comfortable ways to travel . I agree that group tour maybe less demanding and easier way to travel new places . However , think about what you actually want to acquire during your travel . Is it few fancy pictures of you with nice looking backgrounds ? Or , is it once in a lifetime experience that you will remember for the rest of your life ? If it is the later that you want , you need to travel by yourself , and experience it for yourself .",KOR," Is the best way to travel is going on a trip in a group led by a tour guide ?

"(SPA) From my personal point of view this matter is a very hard issue to agree or disagree with . Because we can not predict the future . I think that cars are something that cause a lot of problems nowadays . For example , in big cities such as : Madrid . Paris , London or New York the traffic is horrible and this causes a lot of problems . People are late most of the times because of traffic , have a lot of problems , such as , accidents because of traffic , some people even have bad temper because of the traffic jams . And all of this is caused because we have too many cars on the streets . I know that having your own car has a lot of advantages . Because if you have your own car you can go wherever you want and whenever you feel like it . But in my opinion people should not be so selfish and think in all the disadvantages . For example I think that cars cause a lot of pollution that damage our enviorment and damage our health too ! I can not agree with this statement , at least at this point . Because I think that people is very lazy and preffer spending their money in a car than spendig it on public transportation . People preffer doing this for many different reasons not only because they are lazy , I think that public transportation is not good enough to trust in it one-hundred per cent .

(GER) Cars have become the most impotant way of moving from one place to another since they were invented in the end of the 19th century . In the following essay I want to make clear why I personally believe that the number of cars will rise in the future . The first point I want to mention is that we live in a growing society . The world 's population have risen for last decades . And so it will in the future . This is a clear sign for an increasing demand in cars all over the world . Another really important point is that not only the world 's population rises but also the wealth of people grows . China and India are some of the fastest growing economies around the globe . With an accumulated population of more than 2.4 billion people there is a huge potential of future car owners . If just half the population of these two countries will buy a car within the next 20 years the amount of overall cars will rise significantly . Also an important reason for the assumption of a rising number in cars is that there is no real alternative . In most big cities like London or New York public transport ca n't even cope with the amount of users at the moment . Flying have become cheaper though but it still is n't an real alternative to the car . Because it still is too expansive . In conclusion one can say that there are enough signs that clearly point to an ongoing increas in car numbers . The growing populations just makes sure that there are enough drivers . Far more important is that the very strong economic situation of emerging countries like India and China provides these potential drivers with the money and therefore with the opportunity to buy a car . And because we have no real alternative to the car these people will buy one if they can afford it .,GER, Cars have become the most impotant way of moving from one place to another since they were invented in the end of the 19th century .

"(KOR) Advertisements , which are important in selling products , make products seem better than they are in order to make it more appealing to consumers . Advertisers use many tricks and even false information to make the products seem better . Advertisements use aspects that appeal to people 's senses , such as the way the product looks , smells , or feels . Most advertisements use vivid imagery to attract attention . Advertisers enhance the appearance of the product by different effects such as lighting or coloring . Commericials for food products sometimes do not use the real product , but a imitation that is made unrealisitically . For instance , when advertising a hamburger , advertisers might use a bigger or a more fresh looking imitation of the hamburger . When a person actually goes to buy the product , they will notice a significant difference in the real product in comparison to the product shown in the commericial . Also , many advertisements use claims that are usually false . The advertisement might imply that the product makes a person looks more beautiful or has the power to make someone smarter . A commercial for perfume might imply that the person using the product gains more attention from people . However , these claims are highly exaggerated to make the product popular among customers . Advertisers use people 's weakness to appeal to them . For example , an advertisement commericializing a product that can lead to weight loss might show someone who is obese so that the consumer can relate to the advertisement and be convinced into buying the product . It is important for the consumer to question the product objectively . In conclusion , by different effects and methods , advertisements enhance the quality of the product , making it seem better than it actually is . This is to strengthen the purpose of the advertisements , which is to sell the product to many people .",KOR," Advertisements , which are important in selling products , make products seem better than they are in order to make it more appealing to consumers . Advertisers use many tricks and even false information to make the products seem better . Advertisements use aspects that appeal to people 's senses , such as the way the product looks , smells , or feels . Most advertisements use vivid imagery to attract attention . Advertisers enhance the appearance of the product by different effects such as lighting or coloring . Commericials for food products sometimes do not use the real product , but a imitation that is made unrealisitically . For instance , when advertising a hamburger , advertisers might use a bigger or a more fresh looking imitation of the hamburger . When a person actually goes to buy the product , they will notice a significant difference in the real product in comparison to the product shown in the commericial . Also , many advertisements use claims that are usually false . The advertisement might imply that the product makes a person looks more beautiful or has the power to make someone smarter . A commercial for perfume might imply that the person using the product gains more attention from people . However , these claims are highly exaggerated to make the product popular among customers . Advertisers use people 's weakness to appeal to them . For example , an advertisement commericializing a product that can lead to weight loss might show someone who is obese so that the consumer can relate to the advertisement and be convinced into buying the product . It is important for the consumer to question the product objectively . In conclusion , by different effects and methods , advertisements enhance the quality of the product , making it seem better than it actually is . This is to strengthen the purpose of the advertisements , which is to sell the product to many people .",KOR+CHI+JPN

Or , at least , those cars will mainly use some clean sustainable energy source , other than oil . I think there are several reasons to support this forecasting .

Also , people are becoming increasingly awared about critical environmental problems of air pollution and other types of contamination . What about oil pools . Although oil industry is a very lucrative business and enterprises are main interested about benefits , rather than environmental safety , a change in the type of energy sources they use is mandatory because of scarcity of oil that in some years will prevent from using this energy for cars engines .

"(TUR) I believe it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because I strongly believe that focus is a very important element for anyone seeking success . Having broad knowledge of many subjects does not make us experts in any of these subjects whereas focusing on a single subject helps us fully comprehend that subject and have more control over it . Without focus , there is no direction or goal . Specializing in one specific subject allows us to research everything about that subject more thouroughly . It is easier not get distracted by irrelevant information when one has a single issue to deal with than many . I experienced this six years ago when I started studying fine arts in college and took classes from every department including painting , drawing , sculpture , ceramics , fashion and illustration . It was exhausting to try to practice all of them together , so I decided to focus on painting which was the one I was most interested in . Now I am a painter , and I can say I know more about painting than anything else and this has brought self fullfillment to my life . No matter how some people might think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better , it is an undeniable fact that we have limited time to spend on each of these subjects .

"(TEL) I disagree with the statement that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . Today due to vast expansion of infrastructure and man power , specializing on a particular subject would lead to a positive and creative solutions . The globalisation which is rapidly growing across the globe requires totally refined finished products unlike expecting for conventional products in the primitive times . This statement can be clearly explained with the help of an example , lets take civilengineering into account , civil engineering is an unision of 6 areas of specialization namely foundation engineering , structural engineering , environmental engineering , construction planning and management , water resources engineering and transportation engineering . If we try to gain a broad knowledge of all these subjects it would be difficult for an engineer or a researcher in these fields to deliver a refined design which would suit the present trend . This is because all the fields of specialisation mentioned above are entirely different from each other . The foundation engineering deals with foundation design , structural engineering deals with the super structure design and in this way each has its own entity , so a good engineer having a sound knowledge in any one area can excel in that field and would be able to deliver all the requirements needed in that specific field . Taking highway engineering into consideration , its totally distinct from other fields as it deals with pavement design and harbour design . Hence for an efficient engineer or a researcher in this field would be able to derive better designs from the knowledge he gained through this specialized field . In the similar way an environmentalist could give proper suggestions on air , water and marine pollutions more effectively than a person having a broad knowledge in this field . The branch of civil engineering is just an example to explain why gaining knowledge in a particular specialization is needed rather than gaining broader knowledge in all the fields . The strong belief which is coming from our primitive ages that , its better to concentrate on one particular thing rather than putting hands in various fields in order to get positive results . This conceptual belief proves that `` old is gold '' and is very much applicable in the present scenario as each and every individual is aiming for an accurate result in all the fields . This belief can also be explained by a concept called `` SIX SIGMA '' , this concept is used in firms which produce goods of various kinds , the accuracy level achieved through this concept is that only one part produced is proven to be defective in 1 million parts produced . This accuracy level is achieved through rigorous research and effort made by technologists in this particular field . Hence I strongly believe and personally commit to the comment that having specialized in a particular subject fetch excellent and innovative results rather than gaining broad knowledge of many academic subjects .",TEL," I disagree with the statement that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

"(TEL) I will agree to the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . If we learn ideas and understand concepts then we can question those ideas which would lead to new way of thinking and lead to discover new things . If we learn facts then there is nothing much to change either you know the answer or you do not , but if you new the concept that leads to the fact then the student would use that concept to arrive at the answer . For example if the student wanted to know the circumference of a pentagon then if the student only learned facts the he may have forgotten the equation , but if a student knew that circumference of any object was the total length of the sides then he can add the length of each side and get the answer . The importance of education is not in knowing the capitals of all countries nor in learning the entire science book by heart but to use , what the student has learned in the school , in his every day life , to better his life , to use it when faced with a challenge and come out winning . Learning facts may help you sometimes in your life but completely understanding the subject will always help you . There are six basic questions to everything - when ? where ? why ? how ? what ? which ? If you knew the answer to only one question then the education would be incomplete , only by understanding the entire concept will the student know all the answers and the exact meaning of a subject . lastly on a broader note , for a society to evolve and progress in culture and education we need new ideas , new concepts because if we do not develop new ideas we would still believe that Earth was flat and was the center of the universe , this way of thinking would have had a detrimental effect on humans as a whole and we would still be living like animals .",TEL," I will agree to the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .

"(GER) I deeply agree to the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they actually are . In fact , I believe that many products would hardly be bought at all if people only knew the product itself and not the advertisement that goes along with it . My opinion on this has been influenced by experience and by academic studies , and I would like to state several reasons for my answer . First of all , the psychological mechanisms behind advertisments are rather obvious . It is easy to see that a galopping horse and a handsome man have not much in common with the taste of a cigarette , but the positive feelings created by the descibed image do influence a persons feelings towards the advertised brand . This can be explained psychologically and physiologically , and I am sure that studying Psychology has helped me understand the underlying principles better . The advertisement industry is a huge and powerful one and the quality of an adverts thoroughly influences the selling numbers of a product . In one lecture on the psychology of advertisements I heard about certain techniques that are employed by advertisers which have only deepened my opinion on advertisements . An example of the fakeness of the presented product is the fact that the thickly streaming milk one can see in an advertisement for cornflakes is as tasteless as the flakes themselves : the milk is actually glue and the flakes are made of plastic . I am convinced that most advertising companies employ similar techniques to make the products seem supernatural and generally better than they are . It is unlikely that a company could still compete with others if they simply stated that their product was good . It seems like a good idea to have certain regulations in advertising . These do already exist and it seems almost necessary to protect consumers from being lured into purchasing a product that only seems attractive because of the idea sold along with it . It makes sense that a producer wants his product to shine in the best light . However , I think that the techniques being used in advertising these days go far beyond what one could call a realistic image of a product .

On the other hand , due their valuable experinces , senior citizens could have chance to enjoy more than youth . Firstly , the younger people , due to very biological and hormonal feature of their bodies , are very enegetic , which could not be compared to energy of older people . Being energetic gives youngsters a chance to do too many things within very short periods of time . On the other hand , elderly even there are too many energetic old people , cannot due the same amount of things within the same period and also within the same quality . Secondly , young people do not worry to much about their prospective futures .

"(FRE) One must realize that the statement according to which there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today can be easily challenged or confirmed This assumption is obviously inaccurate when compared to the various economic results and financial statements rendered nowadays by the car companies . Except for a few of them , such as General Motors in the USA or Peugeot more recently in France ( both experiencing severe financial distress ) , the major companies have increased their financial income . The continuous purchase of cars by consumers as well as the perpetual will to consume that characterizes modern occidental societies explicitely proves that the car industry is booming . This phenomenon is n't likely to stop , especially when the wide variety of prices offered by the companies ( from the cheap car to the ultra luxurious one ) satisfies every consumer . The car industry adapts perfectly to the consumer , and it seems difficult to imagine that there will be less cars in twenty years than there might be today . Nevertheless , this statement could be partially true , for three main reasons . First of all , major cities have nowadays developped various transport services for their inhabitants , which have the double advantage of being more useful and fast . It is unanimously admitted that taking the metro today is far more convenient than using a car , especially in cities where traffic jam seems to appear as the principle rather than the exception . Second of all , the price of fuel has increased in such way that it now constitutes an undeniable factor to take into consideration in the purchase of a car . Fuel being so expensive , any consumer will not necessarily be able to afford on a long-term basis the fuel necessary for his transports . Finally , the ecological argument is more and more put forward to demonstrate how the use of cars can harm our environment .

One fact that may cause this is that there will be more single people than nowadays , and they will all need a way of transportation from home to their place of work .

"(KOR) Some people say being a specialist in a specific field is most important thing in the ever-changing society . However , I strongly believe that having broad academic knowlege is much important than being a specialist . First of all , learning wide knowledge of various subjects is helpful to be well-rounded people and have a good relationship with others . When people learn the only one subject , they are well fitted in the field , but might not be a general people who mingle with any others . For example , Tae-hun Kim , who is my university friend , is on psychology major . He did not know about any other subject . Some day when I ask other friends to join a party in Kim 's house , they answered reluctantly . I knew why they did . That was because Kim always talks only about psychologic issue . On top of that , it is beneficial not only to social relationship , but also to get good job in these day . Many company want to recruit versatil people who can be adjusted any department . Some department needs speicialists , but most of departments teach new people to work together .

"(GER) To start with , I must admit that I like watching advertisements on TV or at the movie theatre as well as I like to look at them in newspapers and magazines .

"(KOR) Cars can be found easily in the world nowadays . The first thing that Korean college students usually buy these days are cars . Because the world is becoming more globalized and mobilized , some people believe that in the near future as near as in twenty years , there will be more cars than there are right now . However , I strongly disagree with that opinion for two reasons ; firstly because the air pollution problem in earth is too critical , and secondly , people will make inventions that will replace cars in the future . First of all , Cars will be fewer in twenty years because it generates too much air pollution . Because of cars , the air consists carbon-dixoided too much . This phenomenon is causing the world to destruction . Global-warming is becoming a more of a reality because of cars . The UN and many other associations are stressing with this problem and they are finding a way to stop air pollutions . Thus , because cars are one of the highest priorities of causing air pollution , they will be decreased in the near future . Secondly , Many inventions are now being made to replace cars . Technology is advancing in a very frightining speed and in this rate , people may be able to use other vehicles as their primary transportation . Also , public transportations like subways and trains that run by fuel other than fossil fuel are being constructed rapidly everywhere . Even right now people in Korea are considering that public transportations are better than cars in various ways ; economical , social , political and etc . By this rate , in twenty years there wo n't be a place that is impossible to go to by public transportation . In conclusion , In two decades there will be fewer cars in use than right now because firstly , air pollution problem has become something so critical that cars may eventually disappear slowly in the future , and secondly , considering the technological advancement rate as an evidence , inventions in the future and public transportation will replace the role of cars . Nowadays , hybrid cars that use hydrogen and electricity are being manufactured . However , studies have shown that this method is very negative economically because when the hydrogens that will be used for fuel are divided from other parts that consist H2O ( water ) , it uses up up to 4 times the energy it later generates . Solar power cars are also making no progress these days .

"(HIN) I am agree with the given statement . According to day to day experience as a student I can say , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . Firstly , lets elaborate it by citing an example . In maths subject there are few facts , based on which a student has to do sum . But is that possible that only by learning the facts the student will be able to solve a given sum . untill a student donot understand the concept of solving proper type of sum , he will stuck up with the sum . By only learning maths facts student will be able to solve only a particular type of sum . If he has not understood the concept of solving it , he will not be able to solve the same kind of sum if the sum is slightly twisted . secondly , if a student doesnot understand any subject and just mug up the facts of the subject , he will not be able to retain it for long . It is a proved fact , that the things which are understood are more retentive than the things which are just mugged up . By understanding any topic of a subject a student can use it more practically . Thirdly , lets consider medical students . If a medical student just learn the facts about human body and donot understand it , he can do big mistakes and it will be a question of life and death . If he has not understood human body and just learned the facts , whenever he will find a slightly differnt disease , he will not be able to prescribe any medicine .

"(TUR) Today , specialization on a specific academic subject is a must for most of the researchers . Where innovations need different appoaches to the problem , most of the research work carried out today requires improvements on the previous results . Having a broad knowledge on a specific topic is not enough to improve an existing research , even to do innovations . Instead , science makes harder to specialize where it eases to access knowledge . Improvements and innovations in science pushes people to specialize on certain topics rather than having the broad knowledge on seperate topics . New innovations , improvements require more and more specialization on the studied topic since the research area divides into sub-areas . For example , the first computer was made by electronical engineers while the future improvements lead to a new academic area called `` computer science '' . At this point , no generic improvements can made on this area , because it is already divided into several sub-areas like networking , computer vision , algorithms , etc . These sub-areas are also dividing into sub-areas , like wireless networking , leading to the constant specialization on the certain area . Specialization on a specific area lets researchers to concentrate on the subject that they are researching on , making unnecessary parts unavaliable . In the early times of computers , programming and electronical engineering were closely related and most of the research is carried on by the people with the electronics background . But with the improvements on the technology , programming and electronics begin to split up . Today , there is still related subjects which brings computer scientists and electronical engineers together , but today for most of the people working on the electronics field , programming is not a `` must '' if they research on computers . In today 's world , information is widely accessible with technologies used like world wide web ( www ) . In the old times , accessing knowledge was hard because of using books , connection problems and distances between researchers from different cities or countries . Today 's technology allows everyone to access knowledge and have it . So this forces people to specialize on topics instead of having broad information alone . Specialization on certain academic subjects increased the opportunity to improve previous work and innovate . Having only the broad information is not enough for future tech .",TUR," Today , specialization on a specific academic subject is a must for most of the researchers .

Having a broad knowledge on a specific topic is not enough to improve an existing research , even to do innovations . Instead , science makes harder to specialize where it eases to access knowledge . Improvements and innovations in science pushes people to specialize on certain topics rather than having the broad knowledge on seperate topics . New innovations , improvements require more and more specialization on the studied topic since the research area divides into sub-areas . For example , the first computer was made by electronical engineers while the future improvements lead to a new academic area called `` computer science '' . At this point , no generic improvements can made on this area , because it is already divided into several sub-areas like networking , computer vision , algorithms , etc . These sub-areas are also dividing into sub-areas , like wireless networking , leading to the constant specialization on the certain area . Specialization on a specific area lets researchers to concentrate on the subject that they are researching on , making unnecessary parts unavaliable . In the early times of computers , programming and electronical engineering were closely related and most of the research is carried on by the people with the electronics background . But with the improvements on the technology , programming and electronics begin to split up . Today , there is still related subjects which brings computer scientists and electronical engineers together , but today for most of the people working on the electronics field , programming is not a `` must '' if they research on computers . In today 's world , information is widely accessible with technologies used like world wide web ( www ) . In the old times , accessing knowledge was hard because of using books , connection problems and distances between researchers from different cities or countries . Today 's technology allows everyone to access knowledge and have it . So this forces people to specialize on topics instead of having broad information alone . Specialization on certain academic subjects increased the opportunity to improve previous work and innovate . Having only the broad information is not enough for future tech .",ARA+TUR
"(ITA) In my opinion , in the first part of our academic path , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . There are many reasons which support my point of view . First of all , people need to have a good knowledge of the most of subjects in order to understand which is the one they like most . How can we know what we like if we do n't know the distinct possibilities ? Otherwise , without a 360 degrees view , he would n't be able to say which is his our favourite field of interest . The second point regards the importance of any single subject . Each one of those transmits something unique and unsubstitutable . As mathematics developes our right part of the brain , literature and art work on the left one . And the same concept could be inferred to all other subject . The study of a given subject , does n't only increase our knowledge of it , but improves also some of our personal skills and I think we need any kind of capacities in order to to be successful in life . Another important point is about the social consequences of a high bandwidth knowledge . Being informed on a lot of subject opens us the chance to have conversations in distinct contexts and thus the chance of knowing distinct people . I think it is very important in a man 's life to have a large variety of knowledges because it could lead to an active social life . However , even if it has to be most consistent part , I think a horizontal study of many academic subject has to be necessarly followed by a more vertical phase .

"(ITA) The ability to understand ideas and concepts could be considered the base of education .

"(GER) `` Taking risks and gainig success is a combination which connot be split , because one thing is the reason for the other one '' . This was nearly the first setence I heard by my professor of economics . Now , approximately 18 months after I heard this statement , I am discussing the advantages and disadvantages of people who take risks and the effect this has on their success . I reckon that , as it can be observed in the global economy , business just seems to work by taking risks . Therefore people like managers , who are involved in deciding-processes , are responsible for their decision . In some cases they can be wrong , but in others , they are right and for being right they ear honour , apart from the money they get , which makes them successful even in another direction . If there were no people taking these risks , our whole economy would not be so developed as it is , because without visions of people and their risks to put them into action , many of us would not have a job for instance . Additionally , I think that it is routine that makes people sick of the life they live . People who always do the same things for years are often unsatisfied with their life . I would truly recommend those people to live their dreams and to go for their goals , because everybody has visions and targets , which are worth to be fought for . However , in my opinion , every change is connected with a certain risk . Consequently everyone should balance if a new beginnig would lead to a better state of satisfaction . It appears to me that successful people nearly all share one common character trait : their self-confidence . Self-confidence is absolutely a most for being successful because there are always hard situations and some people who do not make life easier for someone , who is progress of changing something . Finally it want to support my arguments by citing my own philosophy of life : `` By taking risk , connected with a bit of luck , people can built a bridge from all the stones they get thrown on their track to success and satisfaction .

"(TUR) I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . They want to live life fully to the end and enjoy it . I have good reasons to support this idea . First of all , young people have more enthusiasm to try new things and enjoy them . For example , if you have asked a 20 years old college kid if he wants to do rafting , he would go for it . However , if you have asked the same question to a 50 years old man , he would probably say that he is too old to try it . So , this is the first reason why I believe that younger people enjoy life more . Secondly , young people are more spontenaous . For example , if a friend have called and asked to go out for dinner in half an hour , a young person would say `` ok , I 'll see you there in half an hour '' , but an older person would stay home with the family because they have responsibilities . Thus , young person would have fun and enjoy the dinner . Also , I believe that as people get older , they become less energetic which keeps them away from enjoying life . For example , my grandmother is 75 years old and I can never take her out to do shopping which I enjoy a lot . She finds it very exhausting and prefers to stay home by herself . Then , she thinks about my grandfather who passed away 10 years ago and gets depressed . This is another reason why older people can not enjoy life as much as young people . Finally , the friends have great impacts . When you are 20 years old , you would have friends around your age , almost the same maturity . Even if you were a boring person , they would push you to enjoy the life and have fun . However , when you get older , you can not have the same realtionship with the friends . In conclusion , I believe that younger people enjoy life more than the older ones . I believe that everything is possible and easier to do when you are young . So , we should not postpone anything for later .",TUR," I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . They want to live life fully to the end and enjoy it .

If this risk turns to be fruitful , we can say that the risk the man taken succeeded . We can also say that the man is a successful man . If a man goes on doing the same work he knows how to do well sometime or the other he will feel life to be boredom . So taking risk makes man to live lively . If our premature man have not taken the risk of finding fire , we might be eating the same raw meat and uncooked food . If they have not taken the risk of hunting animals in those days the human race that we see now may not be existing .

"(ITA) I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . There are at least three reasons that can help support this point of view . First of all , young people receive enjoyement not only from the experiences they actually live but also from the hopes and dreams they can build . Young people have a lot more to live yet so that they can indulge themselves in fancying every kind of future : this helps them being optimistic and enjoy life in a more positive way . Older people on the other hand have already shaped their lifes : they presumably have a job and a daily family routine from which it is usually difficult to escape . An adult cannot change his life or begin from scratch , so that they cannot enjoy dreaming of a different life . Secondly , young people perceive every experience they live as new and fresh : this helps them live life with more excitement . Since they have not seen a lot in life , young people live feelings and emotions ( and every kind of experience ) with a sense of excitement coming from the discovery of something new : every sentimental relationship seems to them as the first , every music or movie or book seems something never seen or heard or read before by any human beeing . Growing up and becoming older , people seem to perceive life more as a routine : in the eyes of the older ones , anything seems to be someway already known or seen or lived . The last reason , is that young people have more time to enjoy leisure activities . Since they are mostly student , they do n't have to fulfill a lot of the obligations that having a job implies : hence , they have a lot more spare time , that they can use in every kind of recreational activity ( like spend time with friends , practice sports , play music ) . Even if they have a job , they usually do n't have to take care of a family : also for this reason they have a better chance to spend time in a more entertaining way . Older people , on the other hand , have to comply with tasks that both having a job and running a family need : considering all the time spent on the job place or dedicated to family , there is not much time left to be used for individual entertainment . In the end , my opinion is that younger people have a more reasons than older people to enjoy their lifes : they can dream of their future lifes , they live their actual life as something new and fresh and , finally , they have more time to dedicate to more enjoyable activities",ITA," I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Secondly , young people perceive every experience they live as new and fresh : this helps them live life with more excitement . Since they have not seen a lot in life , young people live feelings and emotions ( and every kind of experience ) with a sense of excitement coming from the discovery of something new : every sentimental relationship seems to them as the first , every music or movie or book seems something never seen or heard or read before by any human beeing . Growing up and becoming older , people seem to perceive life more as a routine : in the eyes of the older ones , anything seems to be someway already known or seen or lived . The last reason , is that young people have more time to enjoy leisure activities . Since they are mostly student , they do n't have to fulfill a lot of the obligations that having a job implies : hence , they have a lot more spare time , that they can use in every kind of recreational activity ( like spend time with friends , practice sports , play music ) . Even if they have a job , they usually do n't have to take care of a family : also for this reason they have a better chance to spend time in a more entertaining way . Older people , on the other hand , have to comply with tasks that both having a job and running a family need : considering all the time spent on the job place or dedicated to family , there is not much time left to be used for individual entertainment . In the end , my opinion is that younger people have a more reasons than older people to enjoy their lifes : they can dream of their future lifes , they live their actual life as something new and fresh and , finally , they have more time to dedicate to more enjoyable activities",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(GER) Is our young generation egoistic ? The question is always the same , I think . Before I will wrote my answer to this statement , I will ask : Had parents the same meaning about the young generation in the 1950s ? I think yes . It is not the time , which make such things . It is the generation , which make , or here which not make , things in their communities . It was so and it will be in future . The young generation is not egoistic , it is their lifestyle . If somebody is young , he or she have to meet new people and make new experiences . They do n't want to stay at home or in their village . They have to go in the world to see new things . It is important and so they ca n't help their communities , their first and right choice is to help themselves . The right choice I think . But when the young people come back , in their village or in their family , they want to help . In my environment , there is a friendly partnership between the old and young people in my small village . Almost all people in my village go to the church on sunday . It is a nice day for everybody and I do n't want to miss it . Latest surveys show the increase of family values in the last ten years . For most people the family is holy . They defeat them against all . In a communitiy there is the same situation . Either they fight against people who want to hurt somebody in the communitiy or they will stand together if somebody is ill .

It is by getting more and more lazy that they end up using their car for any distance .

"(HIN) I disagree with the statement . If anything , there will be a lot more cars in twenty years . First of all , according to what i have learned in school , oil is not a renewable energy source , but there is definately enough of it to meet global demands for at least the next fourty years , if not more . Second of all , the number of cars has been increasing since they were first invented around the early twentieth century . So according to this trend , I do n't see how the number of cars will suddenly drop within two decades . The reason this statement is even debatable is probably because of the fact that oil is a non-renewable energy source so some people may think that it will eventually run out ( which it will , but not within twenty years as the statement says ) and we will have to find or invent different means of transportation that do n't require oil . But as long as oil is around and accessable , the number of cars will continue to increase . Car companies - like BMW and Land Rover for example - are doing everything in their power to increase sales . They 're giving better offers , their increasing the quality of manufacturing and they 're meeting public demands . As long as they can keep their customers content with their products , which they have been doing since their companies are flourishing , the number of customers will only increase .

They depend on their teachers and on the material itself . So is it more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts ? First of all , from my point of view , learning facts seems to be a good way to study . According to scientists the memory works like a muscle . Therefore it has to exercise to become more and more efficient . In addition i agree on the fact that learning facts is an efficient method to get a big amount of knowledge during the studies . However , as far as I 'm concerned , learning fact is necessary but not sufficicent . On the one hand , this approach should be undertaken in order to get a background on different materails . On the other hand it does n't efficiently prepare student to their futur life . So this method has to be completed by the other approach . For me by understanding ideas and concepts , students know how to adapt to different situations they could face later . For example , in their professional life they wo n't only be asked to use the facts they have learnt during their studies . For me by understanding ideas and concepts they learn a particular way of thinking that could be apply in differents cases . Thus this last approach is more important for me . Indeed their availability to analyse and adapt to a special situation comes from their faculty to understnad .

"(TUR) The lives of youngsters have changed a lot throughout the years . Some people agree that young people do not give enough time to help their communities nowadays . In my opinion , young people do not help their communuties as much as they use to , because they think that they have better things to do like the use of technology and studying . Technology has driften apart children from their communities . The smallest community is a family and some young people do not even help their family anymore . For example ; their is a huge difference between my mother and I. She always tells me stories about how she use to help her mother with the house work and chores since she had nothing else better to do . I do not get involved in these kinds of events that much aroung the house because of the technology that surrounds me . I am so busy watching tv , or playing video games , or talking on the phone that I do not realize some of the things that goes on around the house .

Studying has been an important fact on why kids can not help their communities as much as they use to as well . The amount of work and the subjects taught in school have changed so much lately that kids sometimes have to study all day long . For example ; my school gives out a lot of homework for one night and it takes me quite a number hours to finish it , and by the time I am done it is time to go to bed , but my mother tells me that in her time they didi not have that many homework so when they finished they had the time to help around in the house or in their neighborhood . Kids do not understand that sometimes helping people or helping a community is the best thing you can do in your life . As a result , young people have to move away from the technology that has been drifting them apart from their community , and they have to be taught to study with a program so it will not take that much .

"(FRE) Nowadays , there is so much information that it is tempting to get interested in many subjects . Although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subjects , I prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permits me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it . First , when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic , he has the opportunity to understand issues in-depth . These issues are often complex , and that is why it makes this type of knowledge very valuable . As a result , it is possible to take position on debated issues . For instance , I have studied psychology for many years and in my country , different types of psychology are debated now . Having this deep knowledge in this particular field , I can easily understand the different points of view and make my own opinion . Also I can stand a position very strongly if I debate with someone about this issue . In addition , I think that if I know very well one subject , it will then allow me to broaden my knowledge to other subjects . As everything is related , it seems obvious that an issue can be discussed in many ways . And I believe that having a strong knowledge in one field permits to approach better very complex issues . For example , early this year , the governement of my country wanted to rule a law involving changes in the social system . Since I had experience in this field , it was easy for me to consider the bill from a social worker point of view , but I also enjoyed getting very interested in other points of views as legal or economic points of view .

One is good experience , second element is money and last element is time . Considering these kind of elements , older people can enjoy life much more than young people . First older people have more experience than young people have . Good experience is able to give a person wider human network and deeper thought . If there is no experience about something a person want to do , he or she will not have no idea what to do and who he or she have to contact no matter how the person hope to do it strongly . In addition , older people have more money than young people . It is no doubt that we have to need money so much if we want to enjoy life . Unless there are enough money to spend usual life , it is quite difficult for us to keep my body and soul healthy . Of course , we will not be able to spend buying clothes . Finally , older people can use a great deal of time . Of course university students especially in Japan have a lot of time . But , they do not know how to spend such a precious time . Constrastly , older people well know how to use time . I show good example to explain these elements .

Older people are generally ill , therefore they are always bored and angry . But young people have fun . This is best reason , why young people enjoy life more . Consequently , both of young people and older people live in this world , but they have different conditions such as energy , wealthy , experience . Therefore , they take different tastes from life and therefore , young people enjoy life more than older people do .",ARA+TUR
"(KOR) I agree with the statement that says it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Learnig facts is also important for stuedents , but if they do not understand what that means or what the concept is from then it would not help students . The students will forget the things what they learned if they do not extactly understand the concept . Also , if students keep learning facts and do not make it as their own , students would not be able to make the next step or cannot make more things from what they learned . I think the point of studying or learning is that students can get lots of knowledges that they did not know , not just make students learn facts and do not understand what that means . I have a few reason for my statement . First , some students just memorize lots of things a day before the test and forget everything right after the test . However , if they really understood what that meant and what that concept 's meaning is , they would not had to memorize all the facts , but just read it over so they can re-make sure what they learned . I have read the Korean famous newsletter , and it said that they had an experiment about the students ' memorization with what they really understood and with what they just heard about it and did not get the concept of it . The fact was that almost every students from that experiment could remember longer what they really understood what it meant than that they just memorzied even they did not get the meaning of it . Next , students would be able to make their own next step from what they learend if they understood the idea and the concept of it .

But I think that you can try great challenges when you are able to manage all your skills , so to do well some things is necessary to be successful but not enough .

"(TEL) I completely agree with the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' . Advertising is all about projecting the brand image of the product . The idea of adversting is to improve the sales of the product . This necessarily means attracting customers to their product . The means to attract lies in the image they project . So , it comes as no surprise if the advertisers make their product look the best . When projecting the image of the project , anyone would tend to speak about the positive points . How could they expect their product to be sold if they project the negative shade of the project ?? But the problem lies in the fact that the advertisers tend to go overboard with the qualities of their products . Their steps in making the product desirable to the audience are appreciated , but not at the cost of the trust or belief people have in it . The main aim is to gain advantage over the competitors product . So , they try to grasp the negative aspects associated with the competitor 's product and project an image of their product . This image necessarily speaks about what qualities are there in the products that their competitors do n't provide . The Head & Shoulders advertisement comes as a reference in this regard . It might not be as successful in removing dandruff as it projects itself to be . Some advertisements even tend to put the health of individuals in jeopardy . One classic example I can give in this regard is the Soft Drinks . The recent Coke controversy serves as a classic example to this fact . Recently , there was some evidence that coke has some unreasonable amount of pesticides in it . When coke is projected as a healthy and safe drink , evidences to this degree act as a blot on the reputation . But I wonder if the products would sell off if TRUE information is advertised .

They focus on learning facts , not on understanding facts . In my eyes , it 's possible to pass school only by learning facts without understanding them . Even in universtity , in several subjects , for example in some economic-subjects , it 's possible to get along with learning facts . But for university you shoud fullfill other requirements . If you try to pass live only by learning facts , you have the wrong point of view . You cannot repeat facts all the time , once in your live you have to come to the point where you understand the links between several topics and where you are able to produce your own ideas . On the other hand you cannot achiev anything only by understanding ideas and concepts . Once understood , you have to learn several things by hard . The best example is to learn a language . You can understand all the grammar - but without vocabulary you wo n't be able to have a conversation in this language . I know a lot of smart students who are able to understand ideas very fast .

"(ARA) There is a growth in population . Year by year , the estimated number of people on earth is multiplying . With this pupluation outburst , more cars will have to be present to meet the needs of the people . Also , people are getting lazier each year and they will need a form of transportation to move them around . For those reasons , I think that in twenty years there will be many more cars in use than there are today . It has been mentioned in more than one official estimate that there is an uncontrollable population growth in the world . In under-developed countries such as the South Asian countries , for example India and Pakistan , a normal family consists of six to eight children . In gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar or Bahrain , a family is considered big only if the number of children exceeds six . Now multiply those number with the numbers of families in each country and calculate how many people will be present in the world in twenty years . Imagine how life would be if fewer cars were used . How will people move from one location to another ? Some argue that there are laws these days preventing families from having too many babies . For instance , the Chinese law that states that no family should have more than one child . Even with those laws , one cannot stop the rapid growth in population . Another arguement proposed is that women these days are choosing not to marry for they have more job opportunities and can live independantly . New estimates show that the number of women is larger the number of men so even if 25 % of the women in the world decide not to marry , there will still be 75 % who are willing to settle down with a husband and have as many children as he wants . Population growth will continue to be a problem and more cars will have to be produces to satisfy the people . Unfortunately , each generation produced is lazier than the generation before it . By the time we reach the year 2026 ( keeping in mind that the year now is 2006 ) , the level of laziness will reach its peak . This is really sad but it is a fact that we must leard to deal with . People at that time in the future would n't want to move around on foot , or bicycles or any other form of transportation that would tire them . The only way to solve this problem is by having more cars to satisfy the needs of the generation will come . As my mother would always say , `` What a lazy generation ! '' If that is what she keeps on saying about the present generation , imagine how it would be twenty years from now .

Pollution will certainly be a problem , the streets will be much more crowded and people will have problems reaching their destinations in time for important meetings or deadlines . As much as I am aware of this problem we have to shine light on another important point . Men are very lazy . They would n't want to walk to reach their goal or ride the bike . Unless a new method for transportation is invented that will not tire out the new generation , more cars will have to be present by that time . Population growths and the laziness of new generations are two main factors that will increase the number of cars that will roam the streets in the future . I am fully aware of the problems that will occur because of this but one cannot live in denial all of his life . We need more cars . How else are we going to move around ? Unless a new solution is proposed for transporting comfortably from one place to another , cars will continue to multiply in number as people do .",ARA," There is a growth in population . Year by year , the estimated number of people on earth is multiplying . With this pupluation outburst , more cars will have to be present to meet the needs of the people . Also , people are getting lazier each year and they will need a form of transportation to move them around . For those reasons , I think that in twenty years there will be many more cars in use than there are today . It has been mentioned in more than one official estimate that there is an uncontrollable population growth in the world . In under-developed countries such as the South Asian countries , for example India and Pakistan , a normal family consists of six to eight children . In gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar or Bahrain , a family is considered big only if the number of children exceeds six . Now multiply those number with the numbers of families in each country and calculate how many people will be present in the world in twenty years . Imagine how life would be if fewer cars were used . How will people move from one location to another ? Some argue that there are laws these days preventing families from having too many babies . For instance , the Chinese law that states that no family should have more than one child . Even with those laws , one cannot stop the rapid growth in population .

"(JPN) We often hear the word `` NEET '' in Japan , NEET is the person who has only part time jobs or do not have jobs . I have some friends who are NEET . They have free time , so they can enjoy life without thinking time or date . Now , I am a graduate student . I work for my laboratory from early morning to late at night everyday .

However , I do n't think that it is good that young people enjoy life more than older people do . I have 2 reasons . First , young people need a lot of money if they want to enjoy life as older people . But in most case , many young people earn so much money . If they get money from their parents , I think they should not enjoy life as older people . The money that older people use their to enjoy life is earned by themselves . But the money that young people use is not ! I think that it is very hard to earn money by themselves . When we realize it , we know the importance of money and we appreciate money . If they use a lot of money without knowing it , it is very dangerous . Second , I think that we work so hard when we are young . When we are young , we can move freely .

"(ARA) I completley disagree with the statment presented in this section . To posses any form of knowlege is an advantage for any individual . However , stating that it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects as opposed to specializing in one subject is a complete error . There are many reasons which serve to justify this claim . One , reason which serves as a contradiction to the claim presented in this writing section is if everyone had a `` broad knowledge in many subjects '' there would be no one to specialize in specific subjects and this would hinder any advancments in subjects that are not studied specifically . The statement that having knowledge in one specific subject as being less beneficial then having knowledge in many subjects greatly contradicts the way our world operates today . If in today 's world we did n't have people who mastered and speciffically looked into subjects where would we be in terms of advancment .

I think in todays world companies want people to know everything about the area they work in .

That is also a reason why I decided to study a specialiced subject . I for examble study international finance which is a small part of the big economical area . I think for myself that this decicon the best was I ever did . Because their are so many people who study economics I mean good they may have a broad knowledge about all areas but at the end they would not be able to understand the financial sector as good as I can . As far I know companys are looking specially for people from the financial sector which are specialized in that field . Which advantages and disadvantages would it have ? On the on side with a broad knowledge you might be more flexible . Because those people could work in all economical areas they want . On the other side I am not sure if a broad knowledge is enough to fullfil your aims and make the big money . You can work in all economical areas but to became at top manager you should know about the fiel you are about to manage . That is a advantage me with only a specialized knowledge .

Without having any health issues , nor special disabilities that old people might have on a daily basis , I am just so concerned about my future that it does not permit me to appreciate the enjoyment of the life . As a young people , your entire life is devoted to the preparation of the future and to how to cope with the responsabilities that accompany the life as an adult : a young people has to obtain a high diploma to get a good job to pay the appartment to have a family and to afford for it . This is why a young person might go through his youth without enjoyment . As an example , most of students do , during their studies , a job or an internship , to have money for some higher studies or to complete them with professional experience that might be taken into account by their future employer .

As a young people , your entire life is devoted to the preparation of the future and to how to cope with the responsabilities that accompany the life as an adult : a young people has to obtain a high diploma to get a good job to pay the appartment to have a family and to afford for it . This is why a young person might go through his youth without enjoyment . As an example , most of students do , during their studies , a job or an internship , to have money for some higher studies or to complete them with professional experience that might be taken into account by their future employer .

"(HIN) `` Young people enjoy life more than older people . '' That is a statement which I do not necessarily agree with , due to a variety of reasons based on the sheer wording of the statement , as wellas other issues like the current circumstances of individuals , their definition of `` enjoying life '' and what activities it involves . The very first issue that needs to be addressed when discussing this statement is how we are to characterise the `` young people '' and the `` older people '' ? Does young mean children , aged 1-12 while older is above that ? Or does young include all pre-adults and older include those beyond 21 ? The terms `` young '' and `` older '' are very subjective and therefore greatly limit the credibility of this statement . In order to be as precise as possible , for the purposes of this response , let us assume that young people fall into the age bracket of one to twenty nine years of age , while older people are above thirty . The pleasures involved with enjoying life for young and older people vary tremendously , based on the stage of life in which they are . For instance , a child could derive immense pleasure from spending a day on the beach , simply building sand castles . On the other hand , an older person could derive even more pleasure from driving a million dollar sportscar . How can we measure the relative enjoyment received ? Therefore , without being able to do so , it is impossible to make a claim that young people enjoy life more than older people . It is possible to argue that in general , the pleasures of the young are more simple and pure as they tend to be carefree , with little responsibility , especially when compared to older people who probably have jobs to go to every morning and a family to support . Looking at it from this angle makes it seem like young people have the better life . However , another way to look at it is that at a younger age , people tend to have more restrictions placed on them , like parental rules , school codes etc , while adults or older people are free from such restrictions , to a certain extent , which gives them unlimited access to enjoyment . Older people also tend to have stronger financial capabilities that enable them to enjoy many perks of life that youngsters do not have access to or cannot typically afford . Therefore , for the above stated reasons , I cannot agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people because that involves having to make many assumptions which are unrealistic . It all depends on the individual himself/herself , the circumstances in which they live , their likes , dislikes , their personality traits and so on . A child could enjoy his life just as much as an fifty year old adult . There is no limit that can control such a feeling and so agreeing with the statement is completely out of the question .",HIN," `` Young people enjoy life more than older people .

"(FRE) It is a well-known tradition for students to dislike dates . Therefore , it seems that maybe they do n't like learning facts , which seems harder than `` just '' understanding an idea or concept . Indeed , once you have understood the idea of something , theorically , it remains in your mind , whereas facts are easily forgotten . You can then re use the concept you have learned before , only because you understood how it worked , why it was important , and so on . And , something very important for the students , if they do n't really remember the exact words their teacher used to explain the concept , they can made up something of their own , which may still be accurate . On the contrary , you cannot do the same withs facts . Facts , as it is implied , are precise , occurred in special situations , and were followed by special consequences . For example , you can explain to someone what is the concept of Epicure 's philosophy , even if you do n't really remember all the aspects of it , eventually your explanation may still be valuable for the other person . It is more complicated with facts ; indeed , you cannot imagine how Henry 8th left the Catholic Church to create the Church of England , unless you know the facts , the dates , the consequences , and so on . As far as I am concerned , I think that facts are as important as concepts or ideas . Facts are needed to understand concepts , and concepts are needed to foresee facts ' consequences , for example . Concepts may sometimes be too abstract for students , and the vocabulary generally used to explain a `` concept '' is not really words that we use in everyday 's life , and it may be a problem for some students .

"(TUR) Being a teenager , I have to spend a considerable amound of time with teenagers . Therefore I am quite aware of the behaviours of young people considering community . I want to handle the approach of young people to helping community in two basic parts which are education they are having and the era they are growing . The educational system is one of the important source of the young people 's attitude towards the community . In the past education system was not only meant giving the scientific information . However teachers were able to educate the students in every aspect . For example if a student behaves to a friend or a teacher in a cruel way , that student was being punished . In contrast today students are telling really discusting world to their teachers without getting no punishment . Furthermore in the past since the mothers were frequently hausewifes , they were able to follow their chidren 's education . However today since most of the parents both have to work to make their living , the education of the chidren are most of the time done by comunication devices like television , internet . These causes the today 's young people to grow without respectful education and they become people who do n't help to the community . Although education makes up the very important part of the reason of young people 's behaviour towards the society , the era which we are living in , supplies the important condition to make tenageers behave in that way .

Of course , raise in petrol prices and other minor drawbacks will affect this number to a considerable amount . Indeed , car is the most used automobile for traveling , because it is easy and faster . Considering the technology advances and speedness in the lives each and every human-beings , we can confidently say that this number will ever increases all the time .

Also , it is quickly reached to a state of being a basic neccessity , rather than a luxury . Hence , I dont think people will give up them so easily as one thinks . Relatively , the design and technology aspects of these automobile manufacturing are keep on changing rapidly to meet new and advanced customer needs and also to compete with the problems like petrol prices . For instance , the research on using other alternative fuels instaed of petrol is going on a rapid pace , to nullify the effect of hike in petrol amd diesel prices . Also , the automobile which have the compatibilty to adapt to diffrent kinds of fuels are launched the market , lets say , dual engine which works with both petrol and electricity . On the other hand , the increasing demand and hikes in the oil prices will affect the number of car sales in future .

The most impartant reason is that marketing makes use of or subconcious feelings and desires . Another reason is that products show just convenient aspects of a product rather than a natural mix of disadvatages and advandateges . First of all the success of a product is determined bz its advertisement . Initially the product is just a product , an object which has many similar competitors . But when the marketing section begins the product develops to a subject which incorporates a specific feeling or soul . Let me explain this examplatorily . When for instance Nike tries to sell some new shoes thez are firstlz nothing than shoes . And what makes them different from other shoes ? And how are people able to distinguish them from others ? The companz which advertises the product tries to arouse a awareness of a specific group in society like e.g. young basketball players . The advertiser try to give their product a soul or feeling which automatically rises in a person who sees this product in the media . Thus the adveertisers attemp to render their customers an opportunity for identification with theri product . In this case we can imagine a young boz sitting in front of his TV and watching this new ad and feeling the same as the people in the ad feel . So , it is possible that whenever he gets this feeling he rememebers those Nike shoes he saw last time on TV . Based on this example I would saz that product sellers make to a certain extant use of the feelings and thoughts of their customers . The customers watch these kind of ads and absorb the message behind it unconsciously , which can lead them to buy a product without knowing why . I think that this depicts that we are somehow controled by the ads and the media . And this is really scaring me that I 'm unconciously doing things I would n't do under normal circumstances . Another example which shows that ads make products seem better than they are , is the successful marketing of alcohol and cigarettes . We all know that these products are heyardous to our health and can cause death but especially young people are capable of being seduced by these kinds of ads . The do n't show the inconveniences of smoking like its smell or unsociability but more important is that thez do n't show the hayardous effects this item could ahve on our health .

"(KOR) Many people argue that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .

Also when they get older , they must find a job , and work their way up to higher position , where they would have more free time .

Since it tends to take time for a certain individual to be in a higher position in one 's own company , people gets to enjoy their life after they get older . Also Younger people face many disadvantages that older people does not . Younger people may not have as much freedom as older people do , such as being denied to enter a bar .

"(FRE) This issue raises lots of answers : we have to accurately weigh up the pros and cons . In a way , it depends mainly on the type of field concerned and of the stakes given by the society . Indeed , our highly competitive and technological world tends to become more and more specialized , so that specializing in some areas such as information technologies or science in general are very useful . However , a minimum of competences are necessary in our wolrd nowadays because the general level of knowledge in our society has soared at an exponential pace in the last decade . So you should have also a broad knowledge . Thererfore , in my opinion , both strategies are valuable to have a good educationnal history . Fist of all , as regards the increasing scientific and technical shifts witenssed in our everyday lifes , I cannot help thinking that specialists are necessary . For instance in medicine , all kinds of progress are made everyday such as in genetics stem cells research or cancer cures . These must be accompanied with specialization of medical school students . These progresses are often made in very competitive areas and specializing offers the student a difference with another ones that will allow them gaining prestige and rewards . Another example would be enginnering , while generalists were very common in the past , a better strategy would be a specialization in one or two single subjects . Namely , in that highly competitive field , you must focus on one thing at the same time to be competitive and aiming at one single kind of job . As a consequence , specializing in one subject area brings you a competitive advantage helping you to achieve easier than the others ; especially in scientific fields . However , on second thoughts , because of that competitivity , we have to build also a broad education .

"(FRE) In an age of mass production and consumption , manufacturers engage in a harsh competition to survive . The consumer wants to know that he is getting the most out of his investment and may rely on advertisements to decide which product would be the wisest purchase . It is then no surprise that when companies advertise their products , they focus on its benefits - perhaps exaggerating them - and rarely disclose its shortcomings . Advertisements of beauty products are a good example of this type of embellishment . The consumer wants a mascara that will lenghten , define , and thicken her eyelashes without making them appear clumped together . All cosmetic companies know this and , year after year , advertise a new mascara designed to do all this . Dramatic pictures shown on television or printed in magazines display its unique ability to thicken thicken , but never mention that this same technology also leads to a clumping or , worse , shedding of eyelashes . If the companies mentioned these side-effects , who would buy this revolutionary mascara ? This scheme seems to be working , since the new formulas keep entering the market every year , and women are still buying them ! Diet pills are also advertised as being much more effective and safer than truly are . The typical advertisement shows pictures of ( pretended ) consumers before and after using the miraculous product . Of course , the `` after '' pictures are always taken in a more flattering light , with the happy customer wearing better-fitting clothes and often sporting a tan . They are also digitally enhanced , to the point that one may come to doubt whether these people have even lost any weight or used the diet pills . In any case , the pictured consumers appear thinner , healthier , and happier . But do diet pills really bring about such formidable changes ? Advertisers conveniently omit the need to balance diet and exercise in order to maintain a healthy weight and the customer is more than happy to purchase an easy solution . Just the same , the makers of these diet pills typically mention the possible side-effects in small print , while the numerous advantages of their products are spelled out in bright , bold letters . Finally , even if these diet pills are effective , the customer hoping to gain a better self-esteem and happiness may be very disappointed . After all this person has not changed his or her definition of personal worth along with a new , shapelier waist . In conclusion , manufacturers must resort to somewhat dishonest practices in order to sell their products .

"(GER) Gathering new knowledge and understanding processes of something is of high value at every time in a persons life ; especially during study . But how should a person get new information ? In my opinion the most important possibility to get new knowledge is by understanding ideas and concepts of something . By learning facts , you can get only a small impression of how something works , because it is very complicated to know everything in detail . So by understanding the concept of the solution it can be assumed that this knowledge is aquired by the person . When some facts are only learned they are not aquired . By knowing concepts of something the things , missing by not learning every fact , can be dedicated from the knowledge . In a lecture was sayed that a person forgets every seven years the half of its learned facts . Therefore it is very important that people are able to dedicate facts from their knowledge . So a huge knowlegdege of facts can be made by understanding things . But the other direction is not easy . Another point is , if many things are conceptual understood , the ability of understanding new things is higher than by people who learn facts . So , if understanding of new topics is inceased , the competence in a sector rises faster and the specific concept can be also used faster . After studies , many students will be confronted with researching new things and concepts . By knowing and understanding other concepts it will be easier to adapt the searched concept from other concepts . This ability makes researches faster an more successful .",GER," Gathering new knowledge and understanding processes of something is of high value at every time in a persons life ; especially during study .

Another point is , if many things are conceptual understood , the ability of understanding new things is higher than by people who learn facts . So , if understanding of new topics is inceased , the competence in a sector rises faster and the specific concept can be also used faster . After studies , many students will be confronted with researching new things and concepts . By knowing and understanding other concepts it will be easier to adapt the searched concept from other concepts . This ability makes researches faster an more successful .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(CHI) In my opinion , I do not agree with the assertion becasue there are more opportunities nowadays for young people to help their communities . With the advent of Internet or other media , people have become easiler to get information that their community need them to help . For example , in my apartment , the memebers of commitee announces the advertisement on our community website when they need people to help set up certain event . And they often receive a lot of responses that say they would like to help . Comparing to the past , there are few people informed that they are needed to help something . Thus , I contrarily think more and more yound peole involve in community activies becasue they are more familier with the internet than the people before , and understand they are in demand . In addition , in my shcool , university always encourage students to do something that can benefit our community or society . For example , they are encouraged to clean the streets and help teach older people who are illiterate to read . University do not pay the student that do service for community . Nevertheless , many students often come to sign up for doing this kind of service . Perhaps they will receive award , such as a certificate or a mendal instead of money . But after all , they do involve in and understandour society and community . When you broaden the scale to our society , you can also see that there are more and more institutions which encourage young peple to help disable people . For example , in my country , we have `` Sun Shine '' gas stations , which only hire disable people and young peole who are willing to help those disability .

A person is successful when he sets the goals and works for them to achieve . Once if he sets the goal , he gets organised .

"(FRE) Nowadays it is quite difficult to answer such a question as we all live in very hard times . First of all , i would say that , as being a young person , it is quite more easy for us to enjoy life as nowadays everything is possible . Our grand fathers had not even the half of what we have today , meaning that the range of possibilities have largened . It is also due to the fact that at our age , they were fighting at war . several times my own grandfather told me this so i would realise the chance we have . Secondly , i think this is so not to compare as we have totally other leisure times because of our age . By this , i mean that for instance , a younger one will enjoy doing a huge travel aroung the world while at the same time , someone older wo n't enjoy it as it means to much trouble and moving all the time . Also it is not true to state that we , being younger , enjoy life more than elderly people as we do n't have the same meaning of enjoying life . For me it could be reading books while for another it would be boring to do so . This means the same for elderly people . However , if it is a question of travelling a whole year long or to practice some extreme sports , it is true that we take more advantages of life than anyone else whose working hard to raise a family . So i would say it is more a matter of what kind of schedule you have . If you are someone who has plenty of time to do all the things you like instead of having to earn money to survive , then it is true you enjoy life more than anyone else .

"(HIN) In my opinion it is better to have specialized knowledge in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academec subjects . A person having a broad and superficial knowledge of many academic subjects is like a jack of all trades but master of none . Such a person cannot do justice to any of the academic subjects . Like for example no patient will like his brain to be operated upon by a general physician rather than by a neuro-surgeon . Similarly a teacher teaching a variety of subjects cannot do justice to students of a specific stream . He might be aware of all the subjects he is teaching but he might not be well equipped to satisfy the queries of a student regarding the specifications of a topic . It is advised to have an overall knowledge of various subjects and be aware of all the things which is why we as a student study a variety of subjects at school level . But then it is even more important to give a direction to the course of our studies by pursuing further education in a field of our interest so that we do proper justice to our studies . A student might not be as interested in studying literature as he might be in engineering sciences or vice-versa . So it is kind of unfair to make him study subjects that do not interest him which ultimately leads to his securing poor grades in those subjects . One may very well argue that a student may be interested in more than one subject and may want to pursue his further studies in both . In that case , now-a-days there are many combinations of subjects available which help us in understanding the inter relationship of different subjects with each other . For instance , the application of engineering sciences in medical stream is one of the most studied combination . By the time a student completes his schooling he is in a condition to make up his mind and decide his areas of interest . So giving him a choice then to choose his preferred stream will help him perform well and hence will lead to his motivation and satisfaction . Moreover , there are numerous fields which require exhaustive research and study for their proper understanding and appreciation . A student whose faculty are being used in a variety of subjects will not be able to find enough time and resources to utilise in all the fields .

First of all , we have to improve the condition of the polluted air . In developing countries , such as China and Korea , they have a growing number of automobiles , which causes even worse air pollution . Also developed countries , such as the United States , have as great numbers of cars as before , as they are used to the convenient way of life with automobils . However , we have to have clean air to survive on the earth . If we continue to live in this polluted air , much more people would die because of polluted air . We have to do something for the betterment of human beings . Secondly , there will be less amount of petral available to keep the cars running . Oil is not sustainable resource and it will be used up if we keep using it . To obtain enough amount of oil , there will be more cases of international conflicts and wars . Therefore we have to think of alternative ways of transportation , such as public transportation , car sharing , and even walking to work .

"(GER) As it has been shown by history , countries which have been specializing in the production sector , have been growing economically faster and more effectiv . In my opinion , this can be compared with the differa big range of knowledge in several academic subjects and the specialization in one subject .

There very famous classicla Japanese cityand there are so many temples . That time , I took a tour guide . The schedule was so dense . So tour guide allowed us just 30 minute for one place .

"(FRE) It is a common thought that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . This is no surprise when we think about how good it can make someone look in a cocktail party or in a fancy dinner . Indeed , who does not admire people who know about varied subjects ? But can we say that having specialized knowledge is not as worthy as knowing a little bit about a lot of things ? I think that society does need specialists , that is people with highly specialized skills and knowledge . Indeed , some professions require high accuracy in knowledge . For example , a surgeon is generally specialized in a part of the body , as brain surgeons are . In my opinion , that is due to the fact that people concentrating on a subject learn a lot more about it than people learning a little bit about everything and who just cannot find the time to go further in each field . Other professions , such as teaching , engineering or accounting , need specialized knowledge , which is restricted to a field or few fields , but that is very thorough . That is why I really think you cannot say that specialists are unworthy compared to people who know less but about more fields . I also think that society needs generalists , or people who can cover a lot of fields , because they possess knowledge from a vast range of subjects . In fact , I believe that those people have to work hand in hand with generalists : they can either assist them ( as a secretary would do with a doctor , for example ) or they can manage them ( as a chief executive would manage a staff of engineers ) . Indeed , as these people master knowledge about varied subjects , they can deal with the details of specialists ' work , such as classifying patients ' files or financing engineers ' projects . That is why I do not think it is fair to assert that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject : to my mind , both specialists and generalists people are necessary in the society , and extensive knowledge of a precise topic can be as helpful as more restricted knowledge in more fields .",FRE," It is a common thought that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

In today 's world successful person is not the only one who has lots of money or is very weel know , it is somebody who has done something different from the others . There is nothing great if you repeat something that is already being done by somebody else . Successful people try new things who move ahead and in a different direction then everybody else do . Taking for example the case the ` Dhiubhai Ambani ' who is today being called as the successful person even though he is not present , just because he did different and tried a new thing that is the reson Reliance is so popular today . The new care taker of the Reliance company are the sons of its establisher so we cannot call them as equally successful as their father as they have just simply taken over his bussiness . What Dhiru Bhai did was unmatchable with the work of his sons as he started the bussiness with not much of money in his hand whereas the two of them now are just spreading an already established bussiness . Taking risk is another part of success as it is a well saying ' more the risk involved , more the chances of success ' . As one can also see that a good thing always involves high amount of risk . To achieve good things one have to go through a series of risk involved as according to another saying ' to get the rose you have to suffer the pain of being hurt ' , and to get the success the risk has to be taken no matter how painful it can be . Risks are involved in every new thing or you can say that risk is an internal part of every success one wants to achieve . If nobody would have been ready to take risk there would not have been any new inventions . To be successful in life one have to go thorough one or some other kind of risk . Otherwise success would have been very easy without risk and every person would have been successful or you can say that every person would have been at the same level . Success involves risks . Suppose during the britishers rule over India if every person espacially our freedom fight leaders would not have came forward considering the risk involved and would have lived the way the rulers wanted them to then would we have ever got independence ? Ofcourse not , thats why to became successful and get the independence they had to take the risk of their lives .

"(ITA) The statement in the title points out an important issue in education : is it more urgent to memorize information or to develop transversal capabilities ? Of course students need to learn facts . How could I understand the history of my country without knowing what has happened in the last centuries ?

In my experience , it is useful to know and display some knowledge also when I have to support an opinion , since my ideas become more concrete and persuasive . Considering these advantages , traditional school used to stress the mnemonic side of learning , creating well prepared students . On the other hand , these students could be a bit rigid . For instance , my Italian teacher at highschool did n't accept any alternative way of presenting the contents and she expected us to memorize pages and pages , without asking for any critical development . The result is that I forgot the most part of the literature I studied in those year , which is a real shame ! While traditional school used to put too much emphasis on learning facts , modern teachers , on the contrary , try to focus on concepts rather than on mere facts .

As far as I am concerned , I am a combination of those two opnions mentioned before . My opnion is that if you want enjoy your life you must spend your life both in a young way and in a older way . Firstly , young people are more active and willing to try new things which lead to a exciting life . For example , when there is a kind of new music , young people must be the first group of people listening to it . They can relax and entertain temselves through this new means while those older people keep amuse themselves by listening to traditional songs . Secondly , older people enjoy their life in a more profound way . For instance , an old couple walk along the creek near their home in the splendid sunshine is so lovely and romantic that nobody can deny that their love of each other . Young couple can n't taste feelings like that . Lastly , older people know the importance of reading . Reading is very important for people to acquire more information and knowledgement . Most of young people like traveling . Even travling can give you some information as well , it is not as important as reading because you can n't taste the complex and wonderful feeling of reading .

"(TUR) I heard a joke once that goes like this : God when creating the species gave the dog a life span of 30 years , the monkey 20 years and human beings 20 . But the greedy man asked God for the 30 years the dog had and the 20 years the monkey had and God granted this wish . Thats why they say that in the first 20 years human beings enjoy life as they are supposed to , then they get jobs and work like a dog in the next 30 years and then they retire and entertain grandchildren like a monkey in the remaining 20 . Alltough this joke is n't entirely related to my thoughts it shows that in the first 20 years human being have more fun then in their older age . So I personnaly agree that young people enjoy life more since they have very few cares or responsibilities in life , raging hormones which make them feel more lively and bigger hopes for the future which make them more optimistic towards life . Firstly when a person is young he does n't have any responsibilites that would stress him out . He does n't have to pay any bills , or think about the future of a child or exhaust himself day in and day out in a job . All he has to do is go to school get good grades and thats it . All the rest are problems that his parents have to think about . It is probably the only period in his life that he is only living for ` himself` . Not anybody else . Secondly a young person has more hormones running through his body during growth . He is wild and crazy and his body is pumping adrenaline and having fun just seems like an instinct . Hanging out with friends , going out at night , not caring what to do is a phase that probably all people go through when they are young but seize to do as they get old . The hormones diminish with age and eventually people tend to settle down . Last but not least young people have bigger hopes and dreams for the future making them more optimistic towards life . They can dream of their first job , their future spouse or maybe even the first car they will buy for themselves whereas as time goes by the experiences in life stop becoming a first . Since they are more enthusiastic towards their future goals they will enjoy everything more compared to a person who finds everything a routine .

"(TUR) Although there are some peoples claiming importance of understanding ideas and concepts instead of learning facts , I disagree with this idea because of three reasons . First , ideas and concepts are two intangible feature that you cannot observe or prove with a scientific method . However , facts are real and has been in the world before us .

"(SPA) In my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject . People that do not specialize in one specific subject usually have a broad knowledge of manz academic subjects . The problem with this type of knowledge is that the person usually knows a lot about lots of topics but does n't have a deep understanding of any of them . For example : during middle school and sometimes high school , students are thought various academic subjects , that is to say that they attain knowledge from all of them . The problem that they have is that they do have knowledge about many different things . But since they have to study all of them , they are not really able to completly understand any of them because the brain does n't have the capacity toabsorbe such basts quantities of knowledge . And as a consequence these students can not use this knowledge in order to make a significant progress in any of these areas . On the other hand an individual that specializes in one specific subject can have a greater understanding of the subject he/she is studying . By specializing in one subject the person manages to learn everything there is to know about it and as a consequence he can then use this knowledge to inovate .

For example , the computational fluid dynamics activity needs real mathematics and fluid physics knowledges so a person can then think about a revolutionnary concept . By focusing on one point , we can try different methods to bypass it . Working on something wellknown helps thinking about the major issue and not about mathematics ' properties .

"(HIN) During our last few school years , we are faced with choosing subjects which we would like to specialise in , in the future .

When one specialises in one specific subject , he or she can excel at it perfectly . This can benefit us in many ways . For example , if a person is so good at something , he or she will be so skilled , and will be able to perform the task successfully and efficiently , saving time and energy . On the other hand , when specialising in only one particular subject , we are limiting ourselves and are unable to reach our full potential .

"(GER) I disagree with the statement , that young people do n't help their communities enough nowadays , although it is a difficult topic to decide on . I understand how someone would come to making such a statement , seeing young people rather spending time hanging around at bus stops or the like , or not offering their seat to elderly people in the bus , or listening to them talk about how they do n't care about anything but themselves and their fun , or see them littering in parks or on the streets . However , I know a lot of people who are very devoted to helping others , to making the environment more comfortable for everyone to live in , or who are very considerate concerning their neighbours and other people . For example , the number of young people who decide to do a voluntary social service , helping and taking care of mentally and physically challenged people , or do an ecological service by fighting polution by putting information out or cleaning up the countryside , restoring national parks . Also , a lot of young people help out with communal events like elections , fairs . Sometimes they initiate such an event , or they simply help by counting votes , for example . And I 've seen young people sit in the public library and read to children every week , thereby making the happy and maybe help out the parents by taking over , at least for a little while . Another aspect that I feel should be taken into consideration is the following : Talking about how people nowadays do n't help their communities enough implies two things : firstly , that there was a time when young people were more devoted to their communities , and secondly , that there is a valid measure determining how much help , or how much time spent helping can be considered `` enough '' . I do n't think that young people of the previous generation devoted more time to their community , exept maybe for the fact that they spent a lot more time their , since they were n't as flexible travelling or choosing the location where to live as young people are today . Young people , especially when they are still preparing for later employment , often change location , when they start college or university , for example . And if one only spends a limited time in a community , there might not be enough time or opportunity to get properly envolved . As for the question how much involvement would be considered enough , I think that this is not a question with an absolute answer . Some people may think that helping out in a nursing home once a week for one or two hours would be enough , others would not even consider this amount of involvement worth mentioning . This last aspect alone , which boils down to a question of perspective , is why I cannot agree with the statement that young people do n't spend enough time helping their communities - this and my own experiences with numerous individuals , some of which I have mentioned above , which prove the contrary .",GER," I disagree with the statement , that young people do n't help their communities enough nowadays , although it is a difficult topic to decide on . I understand how someone would come to making such a statement , seeing young people rather spending time hanging around at bus stops or the like , or not offering their seat to elderly people in the bus , or listening to them talk about how they do n't care about anything but themselves and their fun , or see them littering in parks or on the streets . However , I know a lot of people who are very devoted to helping others , to making the environment more comfortable for everyone to live in , or who are very considerate concerning their neighbours and other people . For example , the number of young people who decide to do a voluntary social service , helping and taking care of mentally and physically challenged people , or do an ecological service by fighting polution by putting information out or cleaning up the countryside , restoring national parks . Also , a lot of young people help out with communal events like elections , fairs . Sometimes they initiate such an event , or they simply help by counting votes , for example . And I 've seen young people sit in the public library and read to children every week , thereby making the happy and maybe help out the parents by taking over , at least for a little while . Another aspect that I feel should be taken into consideration is the following : Talking about how people nowadays do n't help their communities enough implies two things : firstly , that there was a time when young people were more devoted to their communities , and secondly , that there is a valid measure determining how much help , or how much time spent helping can be considered `` enough '' . I do n't think that young people of the previous generation devoted more time to their community , exept maybe for the fact that they spent a lot more time their , since they were n't as flexible travelling or choosing the location where to live as young people are today . Young people , especially when they are still preparing for later employment , often change location , when they start college or university , for example . And if one only spends a limited time in a community , there might not be enough time or opportunity to get properly envolved . As for the question how much involvement would be considered enough , I think that this is not a question with an absolute answer . Some people may think that helping out in a nursing home once a week for one or two hours would be enough , others would not even consider this amount of involvement worth mentioning .

Even if they make it a point to attend to it at certain intervals and make some improvement , it would make a lot of improvement . What is required is their full support and their ideas to help it flourish . They should realise that it is a kind of an investment . This will never go waste .

"(ITA) I partially agree with this statement ; according to my opinion people should try new things as much as possible in order to enlarge their horyzons .

(GER) For the most students it is most important to understand concepts and ideas . To learn facts is not so important for them . I think if they understand what the concepts and ideas are about it can be more useful for them . Because if they understand the main idea of something they can also use it on other topics . For example if they understand how the human mechanism works they maybe also compare this with animals mechanism which are in some kind like the humans . So if they only learn facts about the human mechanism they can not compare it with other mechanism . And if students only learn the facts they may not understand them . This is a disadvantage if they for example need to compare the fact with another situation . so something like this would be more easily if the person really understand the topic . Therefor I can understand the students who say that it is more important to understand the concept than learn facts . Another point is that the students need not learn so much if they understand the main idea of something and maybe have learnt to compare this with other themes or situations . But it is also important to know different facts about the concepts and not only understand their meaning . Because the more facts someone knows the more can this person explain the idea and the more easily he can compare it with other things . So I agree with the students but alsoI think it is very complicated to say what is more important maybe it is the solution of any single person . The ones are better in learning facts because they find it very diffecult to understand an idea without the whole facts about it . The other person for example can understand every concept without problems .

"(SPA) In my opinion , I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts . I agree that it is important to learn facts , but if a student end only learning facts without understanding the ideas or concept this will be a mess . Firstly , I agree completely with the statement because since I was a child I was educated : first to understand the idea and concept and after learning the fact . However , although it is important to learn some key facts it is not as important as it is to learn the meaning or understand the idea . Secondly , I also agree with the statement because it reminds me while I was studying medicine and a classmate of mine learned with his father how to make a `` heart operation '' but without even knowing the risks involved in the operation . Imagine how dangerous could be for a person to be operated by a student who does n't understand what he is doing . It would be better if he study , understand the concept/idea and after that he learn how to do it . By contrast , it is also true that some persons starts learning the facts and after that they manage to understand the idea and the concept .

Having a broad knowledge does not mean that one has a good knowledge . However , it is more important to be good in what you , I think . If a person has a broad knowledge of a lot of subjects , usually it is not very convincing . It takes a lot of time and effort to really learn facts about a certain topic and to understand them . Therefore , it is nearly impossible to have both . It would take too much time . Furthermore , when applying for a job one usually needs to have specific knowledge of the respective sector they will work in . Therefore , one should know what profession they want to prepare for and then get a good education for that specific profession . Employers will usually appreciate it more if their employee is an expert in his job . My most important point is that one should not have a broad knowledge because they will not be able to enjoy their lives . They will realize that they are not really good because they do not know details and cannot support their ideas with reasonal facts , for example . Hence , they will get unsatisfied with themselves .

"(SPA) I think it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . In my own experience , I have seen this all along my life and work . If you specialize in only one specific subject , you will always be limited to a very small field of action and will not be able to work or give opinions in other areas that could be related to yours if that were the case . This tendency sytarted with Ford company in the assembly lines in the beginning of the century when Henry Ford launched his first mass produced car . every person in the assembly line had a specific task to carry out and that was all they did . Well , at the very beginning , this might have been good but after a while I do not think that those people like their jobs very much . It is boring and routinary and of course production levels decrease . And this does not only happen in an assembly line , it can be applied to every field of action . During the eighties this specialization had a terrible drawback General Motors Corporation fired a lot of workers and obviously these people were not prepared to find and do another job but what they had been doing for a long time . Those workers had to even go back to school in oreder to learn something else to do in todays world . This fact and other make me agree with the statement . When you know different subjects and have knowledge of them you are more prepared to survive in this everyday changing society , you can adapt more to those changes if you are used to manage something from different areas of knowledge .

(TUR) In my opinion there are two types of students ; one is learning by searching the issues deeply and the others give up searching when they understood the ideas and concepts but it does not mean that to learn facts 's not important for students than understanding ideas and concepts . Trying to understand the fact behind the particular issue help students to get a wider view about that issue . This kind of behaviour also help students to learn questioning the reasons of events which are effecting whole lives of them . But on the other hand to give up following the facts can not help us respond the problems . By this way accepting the results becomes easier than solving the problems . I can easily assert that understanding of facts is as important as important understanding the ideas because by questioning the events understanding also becomes more easier . I mean that only understanding the concepts can not improve knowledge by itself also the importance of learning fact is great . So I can easily say that many times a student should want to learn the intuitions lies behind the concepts . It is like a sense of wonder and it is like a mean for development or improvement in life . Education system also has a great affect to make students notice the importance of learning facts or reasons during their education period . Because the strategy that they are taught in the school age will also effect the way of thinking during their lives . So an education system should teach students to search a concept or an idea before accepting the it directly . On the other hand it does not mean that understanding is not as important as learning fact . It 's like a chain and should follow each other . I mean that after understanding the concepts or ideas the other important process should be applied which is learning the intuition behind particular issue .

Understand ideas and concepts is the key to learn everything . I do not think it is possible to learn in a concrete manner data things if we do not have previously clearly understand the real concept or idea of what you are talking about . Even if certain facts have to be known , I consider facts as secondary in the process of learning . I will demonstrate my thought in several points ; First it is very important to clearly distinguish the concept from the fact , For exemple the Economy is a concept , although the precise amount of the American economy is considered as a fact . As that exemple indicates , we can not clearly understant data things if we do not learnt previously what is the concept . The concept gives the general idea of what we are talking about . The idea or concept gives to the students the elements to understand and analyse by themselves data things . Moreover , the understanding of a concept has to be considered as an entire intellectual activity since it requires all our attention , our curiosity , and our capacity to absorb and understand informations . For these reasons , i think that data things must be used to represent and illustrate the concept and not the opposite . The facts must be used to make the understanding of an idea easie , and it is too bad that the scholar system does not often give enough importance to the understanding of concept . Finally , I believe en concepts since I think that students always keep in memory when they have understood it .",FRE," I agree with that statement .

"(ARA) There are many ways to learn and to exapand students minds today . Whether it is teaching them facts or taking the time to make them understand the ideas and concepts . Firstly , in the case of teaching students the facts , for the students and the teachers themselves it is quite a boring task . There would be no interaction and communication between the teacher and their students . Students will become less interested and may not participate in class , choose not to attend or decide to misbehave , making the teaher 's job much , much more difficult raising the pressure and stress of the teacher to make sure that the students walk out of the class room knowning the facts . On the other hand , teaching the students to understand the idea and concepts make the students more confident and confortable in the future when they come to study the certain subject or to take an exam on the topic . Moreover , it makes the subject more enjoyable to learn as the teacher and the studnts exchange ideas and thoughts to unravel the concepts of the topic . In addition , it also helps the teacher to become closer to his or hers students , to get to know them , understand their way of thinking , to understand themselves where the students weak points lye , and how in the future help their students to improve in their acadamics . Overall , in my opinion , i believe that students should have the best of both arguments , the facts and the understanding of ideas , for the following reasons ; Using the facts make sure that we have accurate information , to use whether its in an essay or in aswering questions in an exam or simply in a disscussion . Side along with that , i believe having talks and debates on topics help the student to feel for the subject more and more and make them feel more involved . A very good example , is in a history class , where the proffessor talks about a certain piece of history like World War Two . You must have accurate data such as times and dates and chronological orders of events . Aswell as disscussing the thoughts and emotions of the leaders of the war and the people of the countries that were involved in the war at the time . Another example is in english litrature , that i personally take myself . One of William Shakesphere 's play Macbeth , there is plenty of space to debate and discuss , such as his concience throughout the play as he kills the king . If i could not share any of my opinions or thoughts i would feel so bored and not as emphusiastic as i am about the play now .

I think that small companies do n't really what their products to appear better than they are because they ca n't sell their products when they have promised something completely different . For example , the cleaning product does n't do what it 's promoters promised . Once you have bought this product you will never buy it again because it 's wasted money to invest in it .

Well goverment ... we just lost New Orleans '' for being ignorant to the world around us we will some day , kill the rain forest , kill the sea with all the oil diging and destroy the world with global warming . We all need to know about `` stuff '' even though we ca n't know about everything , we ca n't turn the blind eyes to the things that are right there in front of you for you to learn about them . If we can make ourselfs smarter , get smarter and let knowledge in to your brain .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER

"(ITA) I 'm in agreement with this statement for three principal reasons . Firstly , the cost of energy is continuing to go up and in twenty years will be much more expehensive than is today . That is becouse the petroleum is going to be finished in 50 years and the territories with a lot of oil are instable . In this situation there will be a lot of people who could n't effort the oil and conseguently who wo n't buy the car . Secondly , there is the phenomen of urbanization in which people leave the countryside for the cities . This phenomen that is has already happened in Europe and America is happening at this period in Africa e Asia . More people will live in the cities e fewer cars in use there will be . That is becouse the people who live in the cities couse traffic or couse public transport facilities have a less percentual of cars respect the people who live in the countryside . And lastly , there is another problem for who has got a car : when you finish to use it you have to park it !

"(HIN) I agree with the statement that the important thing for students is to understand about the idea and concepts rather than learning about the facts . Since when we get an idea and concept about a particular lesson then we can easily solve any problems in that lesson . This type of learning will have greater benefits in students not only in case of studies but also in our daily life . for example , in case of studies if we are studying about the drug mechanism , in this if we understand the idea and concept of drug mechanism we can say its use and the side effects of that drug on the body . But where as if we learn about the facts about large number of drugs and its side effects then to remember them it creates a greater problem but it is easier if we know the idea and concept i.e mechanism of the drug . When we have greater understanding of the idea and the concept we finally achieve a better result but it is not possible in case of learnig the fact . Understanding the idea and concept leads to more easier way for studying as well as in playing , maintaining health etc.in case of playing we if have the concept of how to play then we can easily play the game but it is not true with that of learning the fact . Inorder tomaintain health the main important thing is to kanoe about the process to maintain a good health that it means we should have a good idea . Thus in any of the subjects whether it may be science , maths . arts , etc idea and the concept is really an imporatnt thing that every student should know .

If a student has a greater ability to understand the idea ant the concept he will certainly do good in the exam even if is unprepared for the exam where as the student who do not have the concept he has more chances of not doing well in the exam .

"(TEL) Some people think that young people now a days do not give enough time to help their communities others think that they will give enough time for helping their community but i agree that younger people will give enough time to their community its true . Firstly , In the community there is a lot of advantages due to younger people . younger people think that the community shoul be good because they think that if community is good country will good if country is good they will be good for example the people who are base less means poor people are helped by many group of younger people financially they will maintain a small scale industry by prepering lot of small materials that can be used in our country and exported to other countries then it will increase our countrys fame and export that may indirectly or directly on us . Secondly i can tell that the younger people are the persons mostly spent the elders money .

Firstly , In the community there is a lot of advantages due to younger people . younger people think that the community shoul be good because they think that if community is good country will good if country is good they will be good for example the people who are base less means poor people are helped by many group of younger people financially they will maintain a small scale industry by prepering lot of small materials that can be used in our country and exported to other countries then it will increase our countrys fame and export that may indirectly or directly on us .

"(TEL) I disagree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one . All of us have heard of the quote `` Jack of all trades , Master of none '' . I think I would like to be the master of atleast one subject . I believe that unless one has detailed or specialized information regarding a subject , it is difficult to speak challengingly on that subject . To quote myself as an example , I have a broad knowledge of seven languages . I speak English at college , Telugu at home which an Indian regional language and have learnt a smattering of French , German , Hindi ( India 's national language ) , Spanish and Italian . But , I am handicapped when I have to converse in atleast five of the seven languages I learnt which does n't serve the purpose of learning . I also believe that specialization is required in most fields . Some of those fields being engineering , medicine and law . When you have a toothache , you would visit a dentist rather than a general practicioner . A similar logic would drive you to a cardiologist when you have a heart attack and to an opthamologist when one has a problem with one 's eyes . Hence , it can be seen that in the above cases , a person with broad knowledge of the ailments would serve no purpose as one requires specialists . Another area where I want to illustrate the use of specialists is engineering . Civil engineers are required for building bridges and computer engineers are required to work on computers . A non-specialized engineer would simply do a bad job or a blotched job . We could also consider the field of law as an example . We approach criminal lawyers for fighting our cases in case of crimes such as murder , extortion or kidnapping but we would approach a consumer court lawyer for problems such as adulterated food . Thus , we infact need specialists all the time and in all walks of life ! Another advantage of being a specialist is that people look up to your opinions much more than if you were un-specialized . We would much rather believe a person who has obtained his doctor of philosophy degree in a particular subject rather than an undergraduate student . Hence , i believe a broad knowlegde of several subjects does n't really serve many purposes . Infact , it might even be dangerous . Have n't we all heard of the saying `` Half-knowledge is dangerous '' ?? An intern might suggest a wrong course of treatment to a patient which could have a fatal affect .

The outcome was a great success , more student have a further understanding of what is Mali like at the same time more than 700 pounds is raise throught the activity .

So there should be something which has impact or words that are very interesting . For example , in TV commercials , they uses music togather and some musics are very simple and fun that can be easy to remember to whome wich has been heared it . It is very important to been remembered to customers to develope the sales . So writing the point you want to be remebered or the point that is the advatages of the product , they should emphasize it in best way . Second , Advertisment is the biggest and easiest way to show the goodness of the product and builds up the images of the company too . To have a good sales or , being popular , or expanding the scale of the company , they have to be mentioned by large amounts of population . So to show the product better is the most important thing that you have to concern when you are making the advertisment . Third , I have experienced many times that i thought advertisment has tricked me . Somethimes there are advertisment that emphasizes too much and it very differes to the real product . But in another way , it is not a lie and the point wich has been emphasized are true . It it one of the way to sale things to people and it is not a crime . Every company has their own way to win the war of the sales and honors . Making the advertisment better is one of the way of making the company better . From these points , Emphasized advertisment has no problem do ing so , and it is the way to intorduce the product . There are many advertisment surrounded to our life and we often see them while we are living . The customer can be easily find what we want in a small amount of time spending to search , and form the companies point of view , it is the part that has to effort to increase the sales amount .

"(GER) `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do. '' , is that kind of phrase ones can often hear in modern , western countries , where enjoyment seems to be one of lifes biggest goals . Wheather this is true or not it will all come down to the point of defining and measuring `` Joy '' . But let me approach this matter step by step . It might seem natural and obvious to believe in this simple sentence because of the physical and mental abilities of young people . They are healthy , strong , flexible and abitious to conquer the world , make inventions , found families and many more important faktors of life . But is this really a joy any time ? They are often fight their hectic and fast environment and get quickly older , visible in burnouts , psychological problems , affection for drug usage and crime . I would agree that young people have an higher interest in their environment in general , but it does not say if this interest to create , explain and dominate is joyous or a need , meybee genetically predetermined . How about older people ? When we hear this we might think of those tied into bed , unable to eat and care for themselves . But if you think twice you can find a lot of older people , who are happy with a slower live . My grandparents still travel more foreign countries a year I could even afford . Others write books and give their experience to the younger generation . We should not be mislead by the idea of `` maximizing joy '' in terms of spending more money , doing more extrem activities and so on is always desireable . To summarize it I might be allowed to refence to Kant , a German philosopher . More than 200 years ago he wrote , it is never possible to define a overwhelming good wich accounts for everybody but everybody shall have the right within certain borders to find his own satisfaction ( quoted rater freely ) . Therefore I am tempted to say this question is to be answered indivually . Of course we can discuss it , but the answears tranferred into real politics will quickly show very unpleasing results I assume .",GER," `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do.

"(KOR) People normally think that people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well can have succeful life . However , I think that it is really dangerous thinking and I strongly disagree with this . There are three main reasons and examples why I disagree with the statement . First , it has really low percentage of success . When people try new things there are always a lot of risk . Since new things are not known and proved the people always take the risks . And sometimes it can be really dangerous for the people . If what the people try to do is succeed , then he/she can be a hero and others may respect them . However , that does not normally happen in our lives . So it can be really dangerous for you to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you know how to do well . For example , if you work for a company and you need to finish your project . Then you do not follow the standard guide lines and you try a new way to do the project . If your boss like the project , that is really lucky and good for you but normally that is really hard . You might get fired because of your new way to do the project . Second , the statement seems right because there are some people who have become famous because of their new thinkings and tries . However , it is really rare situation . Only few people actually succeed by their new ideas and unusual tries . Then They look really good because they can be famous . For example , Novel became really famous by making dinamites . He tried new thinngs and finally invented really useful equipment . But if he failed his work , no one would know him thesesdays . Only when you succeed your try , people will respect you and remember you . Otherwise , you fail your work and no one cares about it . Third , you can still succeed even though you do not try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you already know how to do well . Success does not always require your new attempt . Success is just depends on your personal values . For example , if your value is earning money and having a nice family , you do not have to try new things and face risks . You can still have successful life without any new tries . Success deals with your personal values much more than what you actually do . As above , the percentage of success is really low when you try knew things , and it is really hard to succeed by doing new thing .

"(HIN) Young people tend to enjoy more than the elder people do because they are more energetic than them and are physically stronger . They got a large list of activities of enjoyment than the list of elder people . Usually old people enjoy in home relaxing themselves or to the maximum extent of going out for a dinner . Youngsters have a lot to enjoy themselves in there life . Since they are physically strong they can indulge into many activities . I usually enjoy myself by indulging in physical activities like sports example cricket . I enjoy playing cricket with my friends and I like and enyoy the game immensely . The game involves lot of concentration and physical challenges with lots of ups and downs which generates great excitement between us during the game . Older people cannot experience the same feeling as we do . There are many other activities in which youngsters can enjoy themselves in contrast to the activities of adults . Another experience which I remember is my school trip to the mountains . It was a great experience for me and I enjoyed enormous number of activities some of which includes mountain trekking , rock climbing , river rafting and horse riding to be mentioned . Our teachers also came with us in the school trips . Observing them one could easily recognise the difference between yhe level of enjoyment between youngsters and adults . While adults could only enjoy themselves with the scenic beauty of the mountains and the cusine offered at the place or a long walk , we had a wide range of activities to indulge in as mentioned above . It was impossible for our teachers to involve in the similar activities as we did . Thus young people enjoy themselves greatly indulging in wide variety of activities and face the world with enthusiasm and excitement with their inexperienced mind without cosidering the thoughts of other people , which the elder people cannot experience .

"(HIN) It is quite possible that the number of cars in use will reduce in twenty years because of various factors . Firstly , if the public transport facilities keep on improving in all countries , as it seemingly is , there are chances that people will rely on them to a greater extent than on cars . Already , in many parts of the world which have a high quality public transport system , people going to far off places for jobs take their cars only to the nearest parking place from where an efficient commuting source is available . No wonder if the transport system keeps on getting better and better , they wo n't even need to drive to the parking place in a car either . Another factor that can cause a reduction in the number of cars is the cost of fuel that cars depend on . The cost of fuels is increasing all the time at such a high rate that sooner than later , only few people would be able to afford a car . Added to this the possibility that the source of petrolium may die altogether in twenty years as has been predicted by various scientists . However , this point is itself challenged by the fact that other new sources of power ( for example fuel cells ) might develop in twenty years that would replace fossil fuels as the most significant source of energy . Another factor that could account for the reduction in the number of cars is the population increase . The human population in twenty years would increase to such numbers that it will no longer be possible to drive a car through most places as they would be overcrowded by pedestrians . There might not remain enough space for public parking as residetial buildings are going to occupy most of the available space . The condition of the atmosphere would have worsened by air polution by then and various governments would have to impose a restriction on the maximum number of cars their country can afford to accommodate . While on the brighter side of it , we can expect that in another twenty years , people are going to become sensible and mature enough to avoid using cars and depend more on walking and public transport in order to improve their healths and save the environment from various forms of pollution .",HIN," It is quite possible that the number of cars in use will reduce in twenty years because of various factors .

"(HIN) I strongly believe that that the students must understand ideas and concepts about a partricular topic and subject rather than just learn facts without understanding anything . It is most important for the student to first understand the contents of the subject because one cannot know about the topic of the subject without understanding anything about the ideas and concepts of the subject . Just craming about anything is a wishful thing without understanding the subject . For example I a student of Chemistry , in Chemistry there are various types of complicated and difficult theories , laws and reactions . If i cannot understand the basic concept of the reaction how can I learn it and though Chemical reactions are so much tough , and complicated no one can learn it and write in the examination without understanding the basic concept about the chemical reactions that is how it happens ? , how the reaction proceeds ? and What are the products formed after the completion of Chemical reaction . For example take the process of formation of rust in Iron , no student can learn its facts without understanding the basic concent of rusting of iron and I am sure that no student can learn its chemical reaction without understanding what are the compound involved in the rusting of iron and what is the formulae of the reactants and products formed in the process of rusting of iron If the student does n't know names of the reactants and products in the rusting of iron then how can he or she knoes the formulae and the most important thing in knowing the formulae is to first know the symbols of the elements involved in the compounds of rectants and products . The reactants involved in the rusting of iron are ferric oxide , oxygen , water in the form of moisture and they all combine to form ferrisoferric oxide known as rust . so for this to learn and write in the examination the student first has to understand the proceess and conditions involved in the rusting of iron and the student must know the symbols of the elements involved and then only the student can write the formulea of all the reactants and products involved in the rusting of iron . In this way the student can explain the process of rusting of iron and write it properly in the exam by understanding the basic ideas and concepts involved in this particular process of risting of iron .

Even though these countries can produce and build by themselves their own cars , there are more and more laws in order to reduce pollution , including car pollution . Second , gaz oil ressources are becoming rare , and some reaserches state that in less than fifty years all of them will be end .

"(GER) First of all , facts are only short informations given to someone . They describe something as easy as possible . This makes clear that facts are easier to learn and to remember for a short time . In comparison , ideas and concepts come along with a description of a new invention or a solution for a problem . Reading a book about the idea or trying to extract important informations from less important statements are quite common . You have to understand the whole concept and try to look under the surface of the topic . Students who are good at learning facts might also do very well in school . For them it is only learning by heart and reproducing it in a oral or writing exam . Sooner or later they will have forgotten those meaningless numbers or short statements .

In comparison , ideas and concepts come along with a description of a new invention or a solution for a problem . Reading a book about the idea or trying to extract important informations from less important statements are quite common . You have to understand the whole concept and try to look under the surface of the topic . Students who are good at learning facts might also do very well in school .

Unless you are 100 % sure that you vocationally want to specialize in a subject , the risk of not finding a suitable job because of the deviation of job offering is too high .

Then you would most probably regret not to have chosen a more general Engineering diploma such as an Electronical Engineering degree .

"(TEL) I disagree with the statement . I believe that youngsters nowadays spend enough time ( and more ) to help their communities . Let us define what a community is . For most people , a community is a group where the members interact , are interdependant , and where they live in harmony . The young people of the world realise that they are part and parcel of this community and that the development of themselves is dependant on the development of the community and vice versa . The younger generation is more aware of community welfare , helping people in need , the environment , and its development . One area which the youngsters have identified is charity work . Not only do they visit charity organisations and donate to them , they also organise free medical camps for poor children , corrective surgery for people who cant afford it , and in general spread the word . Campaigns where people can donate or pledge their future contribution are organised by these youngsters . They are conciously allocating time for community welfare activites . Proactively thinking about how much more improvement is possible is the trend . Also , people nowadays , especially youngsters , are more aware of the dangers to the environment from deforestation , the ozone layer depletion , etc . These concepts have been imbibed in them from a very small age , because of which they are very aware of the situation . Hence , they make sure they dont cause more damage than they can help . Some of them have pledged to not use plastics after they have understood the harmful nature of it . Another aspect of ` community ' could be the work environment . Having a pleasant work environment is every employee 's dream . This can be acieved only by the cooperation of all the people involved .

"(GER) Today , we are facing serious environmental threats resulting from the excessive use of cars . Passing a gas station demonstrates us daily that gas prices are increasing tremendously . Also on a day-to-day basis , the media tells us about political conflicts mostly resulting from oil issues in the Middle East . Thus , it may lead us to the question if the invention of the car was a good idea . Moreover , it is intersting to think about the question if there will be as many cars as today in twenty years from now . I do not think so for the reasons I would like to give in this essay . First , oil resources are deminishing very rapidly and statistics show that we will eventually run out of oil and gas . This , of course , depends on the pace we are using our oil . But it seems very obvious that the vast oil reserves will be totally gone in twenty years if we use oil as we us it today . Thus , as there will be no fuel in the future there will certainly be fewer cars as well . Second , the car as we use to know it now is probably going to dissappear . Technology develops at a such quick pace that there will be new facilities which will transport us and our goods in the future . Twohundred years ago , people thought that the train is going to be the new vehicle of the future . However , as the car was invented , trains were not the only transportation means anymore , thus resulting in a decrease of trains being used . In the same way , it might be happen with the automobile . Even today , cars are not used that often anymore when cheap airplane tickets become more and more available . Lastly , I believe that the need to get from one point to the other will be not as high as it is today . In twenty years , computer technologies will have advanced in such a tremendous way that almost everything will be possible to do from home . This trend can already be seen today , as many companies are offering jobs that can be done from home using the Internet .

In addition , the traditional culture in our society such as sharing our foods and adversity is likely to disappear very quickly nowadays .

I can not imagine that we would have reached our actual wellness society if somebody had n't taken any risk .

Maybe if the Wrights did n't try we would have saved many lives , but we would n't be able to travel around the world so quickly . One more example would be the longest jump made by a famous dirt bike rider . Riding his motorbike he jumped 60 meters long and estabilished a new world record . If he hesitated before jumping he would n't have taken any risk but he would be just a regular rider , not the world record holder . By the same token he could have unfortunately died , but it 's the price sometimes people have to pay to succeed .

"(GER) I think that the question to either have a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects or to have a good and specialised understanding in one subject is a difficult one . I agree with both of the points to some extent . First of all , it is important for a younger student to have a broad knowledge of many subjects . Schools , in particular primary and secondary schools should try and give their students a broader overview of many subjects . This is also important in the younger years of a students life , because most of the students have not decided what they will do in their future life . They are not really sure what they are really interested in and in what area they want to specialize . When it comes to secondary schools , students should be given their first choices , based on the knowledge they haev already obtained . They should be able to limit their subject choice and cut down on the number of areas where they have to study in . Of course , this would also result in deepening the knowledge in the subjects chosen . When it comes to the last two to three years of school for students , they should be given lessons in only the six to seven areas they are really interested in . Whereas , I think that certain subjects do not even have to be taken . Currently , Mathematics , German , a second language , History or Politics and Biology , Chemistry or Physics have to be studied . I think this is not needed , as different students of course have different strength , not only in life , but also in their academics . I have attended a German `` Gymnasium '' until Year 10 , where we were not able to make any choices whatsoever . Studying 16 to 18 subjects was not an exception . I have also attended an Australian school , only studying 5 subjects . The coice was widely open and no Mathematics or languages or any subjetcs were required to be able to do your exams at the end and gain university entrance . However , for certain university courses , students also had to take certain school courses . One such example would be Medecine , where students had to have Biology and Chemistry , as well as taking the UMAT test , to see if they are suitable for such a course and also later on such a job . I think this is a successful approach for students , which not only gives them the motivation they need in school , but also the requirements to successful results at the end of their school time . On the side , we also have university students who have to be taken under consideration . Of course they are a different matter altogether . I hold the opinion that the less subjects they take and the deeper they go into details in their study , the better it is . At the beginning of a three to four year study period for their first degree in that area , university students should get a bit of a broader overview of the area for one to two semesters . In that period of time , they get the time needed to see what specifically they want to do and with what exactly they want to continue . The rest of the remaining study period , university students should be prepared for exactly the field they are interested in and want to get a working place later on . This is neccessary to make sure that every one of the students is really good at what they are doing and can prepare well for their choice of job . This would give the university students not only more choices from which they can choose their courses , but it would also prepare them better for what they will do later in their life . It would also be a positive criteria for employers when they take people , because then they can be sure that they know what the person is doing and that the person knows as much as possible about what he or she is doing and also the background information that is needed . Time and money is saved as well , as people come into the workforce and do not have to get an introduction how everything works over a long period of time . Therefore , I would say that there is not a totally clear answer to the question , but the tendency in the later years of education for me is towards a specialization in one , maybe two subjects .",GER," I think that the question to either have a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects or to have a good and specialised understanding in one subject is a difficult one . I agree with both of the points to some extent . First of all , it is important for a younger student to have a broad knowledge of many subjects . Schools , in particular primary and secondary schools should try and give their students a broader overview of many subjects . This is also important in the younger years of a students life , because most of the students have not decided what they will do in their future life . They are not really sure what they are really interested in and in what area they want to specialize . When it comes to secondary schools , students should be given their first choices , based on the knowledge they haev already obtained . They should be able to limit their subject choice and cut down on the number of areas where they have to study in . Of course , this would also result in deepening the knowledge in the subjects chosen . When it comes to the last two to three years of school for students , they should be given lessons in only the six to seven areas they are really interested in . Whereas , I think that certain subjects do not even have to be taken . Currently , Mathematics , German , a second language , History or Politics and Biology , Chemistry or Physics have to be studied . I think this is not needed , as different students of course have different strength , not only in life , but also in their academics . I have attended a German `` Gymnasium '' until Year 10 , where we were not able to make any choices whatsoever . Studying 16 to 18 subjects was not an exception . I have also attended an Australian school , only studying 5 subjects . The coice was widely open and no Mathematics or languages or any subjetcs were required to be able to do your exams at the end and gain university entrance . However , for certain university courses , students also had to take certain school courses . One such example would be Medecine , where students had to have Biology and Chemistry , as well as taking the UMAT test , to see if they are suitable for such a course and also later on such a job . I think this is a successful approach for students , which not only gives them the motivation they need in school , but also the requirements to successful results at the end of their school time . On the side , we also have university students who have to be taken under consideration . Of course they are a different matter altogether . I hold the opinion that the less subjects they take and the deeper they go into details in their study , the better it is . At the beginning of a three to four year study period for their first degree in that area , university students should get a bit of a broader overview of the area for one to two semesters . In that period of time , they get the time needed to see what specifically they want to do and with what exactly they want to continue . The rest of the remaining study period , university students should be prepared for exactly the field they are interested in and want to get a working place later on . This is neccessary to make sure that every one of the students is really good at what they are doing and can prepare well for their choice of job . This would give the university students not only more choices from which they can choose their courses , but it would also prepare them better for what they will do later in their life . It would also be a positive criteria for employers when they take people , because then they can be sure that they know what the person is doing and that the person knows as much as possible about what he or she is doing and also the background information that is needed .

"(TEL) The issue given at the hand is the usage of cars in the coming years . This issue is difficult as I have to present the various thoughts in this regard . I think that the usage of cars in the next 20 years is going to increase for the reasons that I am going to mention now . The first reason that I think that people would use more cars because the people in the developing countries are more focused on their travelling modes and are concerned about the comfort that using a personal vehicle can have . This is suggested by the fact that the number to car manufacturers are growing world - wide and that the customers are regularly offered cars a relatively low prices to encourage their sales . Even new designs have appeared and people are mad after the latest model car available in the market . Secondly , owing a car is considered as a symbol of prestige and is no longer restricted to high - income earning people . Any person who owns a two wheeler would dream to buy a car in near future and considering the population of average earning group world wide this claearly indicates that their wil be an increase in the usage of cars . This is human nature to long for more sophisticated things and car is just one of them . Even the point that the entire family can travel comfortably in one car cannot be ruled out . Thirdly , even if the traffic problem is considered , many developing countries are now building fly-overs , bridges and other architectural constructions keeping in mind the increase in the traffic in near future . Considering the design features many cars are now designed to be smaller so that they can fit in the most crowded road very easily . Even the parking problem is solved using magnificient structures that allow many vehicles to be parked at a single place which is usually underground . So even the government is expecting the increase in the use of four wheeler . Fourth reason that can be given is the development of new technology that ensures reduction in the fuel required , even the use of CNG can be considered which guarantees no pollution , increase in the performance of the vehicle and hence overall contributon to reducing the environmental pollution , which is usually bought in these cases , contribute to the increase in the number of car owners .

"(TUR) People come to life once so they might as well enjoy it as they live it . Both the young and the old people enjoy life . Some assume that young people enjoy life more than the older people do , in the contrary , some people think that old people would enjoy it more than the younger people as the time passes . I totally agree with the first idea . I think young people enjoy life a lot . First of all , young people tend to have fitter body . Many of the activities that young people do such as to go to clubs , dance like crazy or ride a horse cannot be done with an unfit body . For example when I make a tennis match with my mother , she gives up after sometime . I definitely beat her in every match because she does n't have that much energy . In addition to this , younger people do have healthier bodies . They can drink and eat without counting the calories . They do n't have to think what would be bad for their calosterol or heart conditions . Hence , young people would be able to go any restaurant or cafe , and enjoy the terrific part of life which is composed of eating and drinking . The last but not least , since young people have n't experienced many things in life , they try new staff all the time . For example I have n't done bungee-jumping before or have n't visited Japan .

In this way , I think for students is more important to learn how models and system work than to have a detailed knowledge of the operations or facts . Probably we can use an example to better explain my opinion . For istance a student could know everything concerning art hystory : the art movements , the life of the main artists , chronological facts . This knowlege is an important base to start a career as an artist but it is not sufficient . I mean that to be a good artist the student should learn and understand the logic and the principles , important to produce creativity and art . If the student 's intention si to become a painter , he need to understand the color system , the concept of composition , the rules how to evoke emotions and how to capture viewer 's attention .

"(GER) The question whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to be specialized in one subject is a very interesting question because a good education is one of the most important things in our lifes . From my point of view , it is preferable to be specialized in one subject than having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects . I am on this opinion because of a few reasons . First of all , I think you have to be focussed on one specific subject in our society . If you are not good in your subject you would not earn much money . So you have to be very good in some kind of thing to get in a high position in a company . For example you have to be good in managing to get a job as a leading manager in a big company . So the more specific your knowledge the more money you will earn . Furthermore , I think that you should have one specific subject that you are keen in or which is your desire . To my mind , that is a natural thing . Every person has a desire in something . Some people like doing mathematics , whereas other people like doing biological research or like doing sport . So every student has a subject that he likes and that he is fascinated about . Therefore you should concentrate and focus on this specific subject . Lastly , what job will you enter if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects but you have not got any detailled knowledge ? What company is going to hire a student who has not got any specialized education ? What job title would be the best for this situation ? Therefore , it is better to have a specific education .

"(GER) I would agree with the given statement , but only to a certain extend . I consider it true that in order to have success , one has to try things that are new and innovative in at least one aspect . But , on the other hand , one has to apply such skills as he posseses in order to get the best outcome possible out of his actions . There are examples of people trying new things , not achieving anything . Vincent Van Gogh is one of these . He did something highly innovative , according to standards and taste of his time , without having any success in his life . On the other hand , there are examples of people merely copying an idea or a product who are enjoying immediate success . `` StudiVZ '' , the german version of american `` facebooks '' , an internet domain where students and other young people create an internet profile of themselves and share friends , is a perfect example : The inventors of `` StudiVZ '' copied the whole idea of facebooks . The only new , innovative thing they accomplished was transferring it to Germany , where it had immediate success . Of course , there is a new aspect added to the original idea in transferring the concept to a different country , but it is by no means a genuine idea . To my eyes , these two examples show that the given statement is rather general and superficial , implying that successful people are innovative whereas the unsuccessful ones are not .

"(KOR) In my opinion trying new things that you never did before is the apportunity to have more chance to succeed . Because people would know what they are good at by trying . It is very important to know what you can do well and also you can enjoy As an example , I used to play the piano when I was young . And I always thought that I was good at playing piano and it would be my career in the future . But as I grew up , I experienced that I lost the interest and the joy from playing the piano .

In my opinion it is not worth discussing this particular circumstance stated in the statement .

"(TUR) I agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . I have couple of experiences and reasons to support my opinion . First , it is always more fun for me to travel with a group of people . Since I consider myself a social person , it gives me a great opportunity to make new friends . For example , I had such a great time in my last trip to Italy . We visited the historical places during the day time and enjoyed the delicious Italian pasta with a glass of wine and laughter at night . It was incredible . Furthermore , a tour guide is very very important for a travel . I believe that it helps a lot to visit the new places with a person who already knows about their histories . It is harder for me to read it from a book . Also , I have a short term memory on those kind of things . The first time when I went to Barcelona by myself , I had already forgot the story of the famous sculptures , so it did n't make any sense to see them without the particular information . Finally , I think it is much better to walk around with a group of people . It attracts the local store owners .

"(KOR) There are lots of perspectives and opinions about the number of cars in use in the future . Some people think that we will have plenty of cars as the days are going by , however , I definitely think that we have fewer cars in our future than today . I 'd like to represent my argument based on the three following reasons : the shortage of fuel , the mass transportation , and restrictions . First of all , we are going to face the shortage of fuel . As we know , cars definitely rely on fossil fuel such as oil and gas . Without fuel , no cars can be moved and worked . Current and future situation related to the shortage of fuel will lead us to hesitate to buy and produce new cars . Furthermore , development in our science allows lots of countries to build well-developed mass transportations such as subway and express trains and convienent bus system . Increasingly , people will prefer to utilize mass transportations rather than to drive their own car when shopping , going to work , and travelling . Developed system in mass trasnsportation will casuse a revolutionary commuting habits to city dwellers . Lastly , we are expecting governmental restictions on using cars in near future . Currently in my home country , car drivers have to pay high tax and fee for causing trafffic jam and environmental burden . Environemntalists strongly suggest that car producers and car purchasers have to pay more money for using car . In addition , many people agree to the idea because they want to take clean air in . Government has no choice but impose more fee and tax for using cars , and will create various way to prohibit car owners from using cars . In short , I absolutely believe that we will have fewer cars on the road in near future based on the above-mentioned reasons .

"(GER) Whether or not young people enjoy life more than older people do is an interesting question , and I for one disagree with that statement . First and foremost one has to understand that enjoying oneself does not necessarily have to mean enjoying similar things . With that in mind , it becomes clear that older people do not necessarily enjoy life less than young people do . First , let 's look at two different rather popular activities for both , the young and the old . How about sports - sports is a rather popular pasttime activity for the younger generation . But it 's also an important part of older people 's lifes , a point that is supported by the fact that certain activities that have fascinated the older generation first but have now moved on to include the younger generation as well ( without of course losing any importance to the older generation , it 's like a side-by-side activity ) do exist . Sports can therefore be enjoyed by both , the young and the old , and does not leave anyone behind . If you do n't feel like jumping down a cliff into the ocean then do n't - there 's other activities like running , iceskating or , the one I referred to above to illustrate an activity moving down the generational ladder rather than up : nordic walking . And what about a very different pasttime activity that both , the yound and the old enjoy : going out and enjoying oneself with friends . While the youth has bars , pubs and clubs to enjoy itself , the older generation usually prefers locations with less noise and more atmosphere , yet not necessarily less fun . If one enjoys a nice restaurant or a dance then age does n't really matter - a 90-year old can enjoy himself next to a 30-year old and both will be having a blast . Yet another point I would like to make is money and time . It 's a known fact that older people , especially retirees , statistically have more money to spend than younger people , who might have to support an entire family of four or more on one single income , do . And unfortunately , in our society money equals fun . A very good example is travelling , which in our society is just another word for seemingly endless enjoyment all over the world . Travelling is quite expensive though , a family of four will not be able to afford a Carribean cruise on a ship , nor will it have time or money for an extended cruise or travels that last longer than a week or two . With more time on their hands older people can usually sit back and relax , enjoy their free time in foreign countries or even at home with their friends . Which , as my final point , is what I think the most important factor of enjoying oneself . Friends are the salt in the soup , and while older people do n't tend to have more friends than the younger generation ( true , I do n't have any hard evidence to support this , but it has been my general observation in my immediate environment ) , they usually tend to have closer friends that they have known for decades . Sharing ones life with a life partner or a good friend is what makes life worth living to some people , and in order to do that age does n't matter - attitude matters . I think I have made my point clear that I do not think that younger people enjoy life more than older people do . From the outside and from a rather superficial point of view this might seem to be the case , given that according to the media - which unfortunately is made mostly for young people - only young people seem to enjoy life on TV and in the movies . It 's a certain stereotype that the movie industry has been presenting us for many years and it seems to have attached itself to our society where age equals boredom and loneliness . Personally I think that if I had a time machine and would be able to look at a 20 years older me I would discover , that the older me would still be having fun in life and enjoying itself just as the young me does right now .",GER," Whether or not young people enjoy life more than older people do is an interesting question , and I for one disagree with that statement .

"(CHI) Life is like a virgin forest , with primitive mountains , rivers , grassland and flowers in it . You cannot pick a peak out of it without exploring or probing the true face of it .

Hence , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . I believe different age groups can experience the identical happiness or joy by appreciating the different beauty inside of their life .

Many Nobel Prize winners who achieved their biggest professional peak , enjoy the happiness of it when they are wellknown and prestigious in their later years . They had a particularly hard time in proving their hyposis or theory in their youth , like Albert Einstein , Nikola Tesla . Secondly , happiness is a lifetime pursuit . People through all age bracket seek for the real joy of life . Many sayings tell us the happiness does not discriminate ages . A wise , intelligent novel or person can win high praise despite of the age of the author . Furthermore , many people think the life is too short to waste .

"(GER) In my opinion success has nothing to do with trying new things or taking risks . What is success ? It 's when a person is doing his best relatively to her or his potential . Maybe it is not something new it is something what he or she always has done . Another thing is the learning-effect and beeing successful in that case . There I agree that you are more successful in the event of learning when you try doing new things . For example a young guy between his twenty 's , doing always the same thing , let 's say , working as a printer . It would n't be successful when he would continue his whole life in doing this work in beeing in the same position and the same company forever . A successful person would try to go further . Change companies , learn from the best in the field , go to school , trying to take a job in the adminstration . Maybe he will fail once or twice . But on the end , he will be successful , because he can look back and say : I have tried new things and I have done my best . Another way of beeing successful is by taking risks . It 's usually a small way between beeing risky and beeing stupid . Most people know they are stupid after beeing risky . As an example let 's take a gambler which put his whole safings on one number in the roulette . The number turns , the ball jumpes and takes place in another number than the gambler wished to . That 's stupid we would say . But if it had been his favourite number , than he would be immediately successful . Therefore , in my opinion , to be risky does n't mean you are successful .

"(ITA) That 's surely a good issue . It is impossible to me to look deep into the future to find an answer but , for now , i would certanly hope it . Everyone understands how it is important to limitate the pollution today , everyone knows that in some hours it 's almost impossibile to walk around . So , from a moral and ecological point of view , we have no other choice but to reduce cars . Does this will happen ? That 's completly different .

As long as oil based products will move cars , people will look to cheaper way to go around . There are plenty of cities all of over the world saying NO to the cars , in Italy , just to give you an example , you can use your car depending on the number of you car and on the day . That 's a good start . Another option i have to consider is a restyling of the concept behind a car : everyone would love a car with low pollution rates , free from the oil , cheap to use and why not ... with a new look . We know that reaserchers are working night and day to create something that looks like that . The issue reads `` twenty years '' , well i 'm sure that in twenty years we 'll see the birth of a new car generation and so the old cars will get fewer and fewer .

There are plenty of cities all of over the world saying NO to the cars , in Italy , just to give you an example , you can use your car depending on the number of you car and on the day . That 's a good start . Another option i have to consider is a restyling of the concept behind a car : everyone would love a car with low pollution rates , free from the oil , cheap to use and why not ... with a new look . We know that reaserchers are working night and day to create something that looks like that . The issue reads `` twenty years '' , well i 'm sure that in twenty years we 'll see the birth of a new car generation and so the old cars will get fewer and fewer . And do n't forget the development of alternative vehicles . Mix up together the the two things and you 'll have a picture of our future and so yes , there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(GER) Although advertisement is a rather effective and influencial way to increase the sell of products in our modern society I agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' for the following reasons : There is a hidden economical stategy behind advertisement : the goal to attract as much people as possible in order to make the largest amount of money at the same time , since every company or enterprise wants to profit most from money spent by customers for the goods offered . Hence there is competition on the market which advertisments for the goods of every producing company is effective for , pretending that the goods of these or those companies are the best ones . A further argument for my point of view is that advertisements for products are not necessary by engendering illusions out of reality since in former centuries marketing which advertisement is a part of not even existed so people only praised the goods by talking to each other about it . The goods were always in great demand and had to be produced since wars occured all over the world much more than nowadays destroying agricultur and economic structures again and again . Modern technology was also missing which brings me to the next point . Today we have this technology to produce greater and greater masses of products for people which are in longer periods of peace than in the past so advertisement becomes important to still get a profit or even the maximum of profits from the shrink of the urgent need of products in order to survive . People must by all means be influenced by advertising campaigns in order to still get attracted in some way of the already long existing production of products of all kinds . There is no urgent use in order to survive in our western civilized countries . It occurs very often that I watch television or read a newspaper or journal were advertisements for several products are presented . Sometimes I decide to buy a product but initially when I test it I become aware of the ordinary use or taste of the product that I already know for years which has not developed to a considerable positive and different extend . So generally to me advertisement is manipulation of people for products that already exist in our everyday life or new products like cell-phones with many new options that are not really necessary for us to survive and they are even harmless .",GER," Although advertisement is a rather effective and influencial way to increase the sell of products in our modern society I agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' for the following reasons : There is a hidden economical stategy behind advertisement : the goal to attract as much people as possible in order to make the largest amount of money at the same time , since every company or enterprise wants to profit most from money spent by customers for the goods offered .

"(GER) In my opinion it is in general better when you have a broad knowledge of academic subjects . Firstly , in many academic subjects , you need a overview about several topics to understand the relationship within one topic and between different themes . I study economics at the University of Applied Sciene in Nuremberg . For example in Finance I have to know the theoretic basics in Finance but I also need the knowledge of mathematics , tax and law . So I am not only specified on one subject . During the semster , we have many differnt subjects which all stands in relationship to economics . For example , marketing , finance , law , tax , accouting . english , general mangament etc . Secondly , it is not sure , that someone always get a job in that subject that he has studied . So it is possible , that he had studied Finance but now works in a marketing department . The situation on tte work market is not so good and so it is better to have a broad knowledge . My friend studied logistics and now he is working as banker , but while his studytime he must vistited lectures of finance and assurance . So he has not that problems to work in this field . But there are also subjects in which it is better , when you are specified . For instance in medical : It is not possible , that every doctor knows everything . You need someone for skin deases but also someone who has knowlegde about cancer . In this case it is of advantage , when you have a specific knowledge . On the other hand it so for the human brain impossible all to know . In a conclusion it is to say , that it depends on the subject and how deep the subect is related to others . On the one hand it can be better to have a wide knowledge , on the other hand it can be useful to be specialise in one academic field .",GER," In my opinion it is in general better when you have a broad knowledge of academic subjects .

"(JPN) I agree with the statement that the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

It 's a wonderful thing to be an experienced person . By being an experienced person , people can solve more problems than those of the people who only know one thing and has interest in one thing . I think expanding your views and being experienced would lead you to gain reliance from people . Many people respect those of the people who have their own point of views and experiences .

"(KOR) I agree with the concept that most advertisements make products seem much better because I experienced the same event . Being a consumer , I meet first with the new products in magazine or TV advertisement . If I get attracted to the advertisement , I wish to buy the product . Thus , most advertisements exaggerate the good side of the product because the producers want the world to buy them . For example , most advertisements do not mention the side effects of drugs even though they can be pretty detrimental . One consumes drugs frequently whenever faced with illness . Even though it is bad to take the loads of them , one takes it over and over again until the disease is gone . I am not sure about American advertisement , but in my home advertisement , there is no mention about side effects of the drug . There is not much chance that side effect will appear even 10 percent but I believe it is better to warn the cosumers with those beforehand . The producers do not mention about the side effects because they want their product to be sold . I believe this applies to any other products . Thus , advertisment represent the product to be better than the real quality . For another example , advertisements do not show how long clothes or the whiteness of teeth last for . Two years ago , I bought a box of `` White Strip '' . I did not pay attention to the lasting quality because the advertisement did not mention any of that sort . I tried them for a month and my teeth sure did get whiter but that was a temporary effect . After a month , my teeth were same as before if not worse . From that time on , I never buy those products again . Consequently , the advertisement did not mention that the effect lasts temporarily because they want consumers to buy the product . Another example would be diet coke . Advertisement say that diet coke has less calories than the original one . If one has ever drank diet coke , she will notice that it is sweeter than the real one since diet coke use artificial sweetner . According to the research , artificial sweetner has no calorie but is more harmful than the real sugar if consumed in large quantities . Nevertheless , the advertisement does not mention anything about those information . It is sel-evident that the advertisement gives the false impression .

My point of view is that most of these advertisements make products seem much better than they originally are because of the competition both in the market and between the advertisement companies . The first reason why most advertisements show products better than they really are is that there are many companies that are selling the same product . Therefore , there is too much competition in the market . To be able to compete with other firms and stay in the market , companies spend unbelievable amounts of money in advertisements and show their products as the ` best ' product that is in sale .

'' When i ate this candy , i saw no difference in its taste than any other brands ' candies . Secondly , besides the competition between companies that spend money to these advertisements , there is also competition between advertisement companies . To make their advertisements liked by the companies that hire them they should prepare the advertisements such that they will persuade the company workers that this product will be sold . Therefore , most of the time advertisement companies are exaggerating the features or the quality of the products in order to be liked by the product owners and be hired again in the next time . All in all , because of the competition between companies that are producing the products and the companies that are making the advertisements , most of the time the products advertised are shown as better than they really are .

Therefore , most of the time advertisement companies are exaggerating the features or the quality of the products in order to be liked by the product owners and be hired again in the next time . All in all , because of the competition between companies that are producing the products and the companies that are making the advertisements , most of the time the products advertised are shown as better than they really are . Thus , consumers should be careful about those advertisements and should not rely on them .",ARA+TUR
"(KOR) I agree with the statement that students have to get the ideas and concepts than just learning facts . The learning will be more effective , improves their brain work , and the lifestyle can change posetive . First , the learning would be more efficient . Students have to think and understand to get the ideas and concepts . And this process makes them think why the facts happen and gives them a purpose to learn . In consquence , they will apply that on every learning . For example , in science class , there are many kind of principles students need to understand , and thinking why this principle happen will make the student curious . That way leads the student more participate in class and has fun in learning . It will be much better for the student to think by himself ( herself ) rather than just being taught the fact and try to remember . Also , it will improve their brain working by understand the concepts . They learn how to think logically and from that they get good grades at objects like math , science , physics , and so on .

"(TUR) There are many different forms of marketing and maybe the most efficient and widely-used form of it is advertising . However sometimes companies make their products seem a lot better than they really are in their advertisements and there are certain reasons for this . First of all , companies advertise their products in order to increase their sales or market shares . While doing so , some companies do not hesitate to do whatever it takes although this may include misinforming the consumers . For instance , many companies generally prefer to hide some certain aspects of their products or the facts about it when they are advertising this particular products . Everyday we see millions of these advertisements telling how cheap a product is . But , how many of them state the actual price ? Besides , yes the product may be cheap , but compared with what ? Secondly , other than hiding some facts about it , companies follow another way to create a more favorable image of their products in the minds of the consumers . They simply utilize impact of media . For instance , the TVs are a very good way to make your product seem ` better` . The visual impressiveness of this media channel is amazing . Therefore by making TV advertisements that are enriched with visual impressions might boost your sales . Also you can use the effectiveness of celebrities for example . The advice of a well-known pop star might create an incredibly favorable image of your product . Finally , by merely advertising your product you can easily create a more favorable image of it . You do not need to hide any facts or utilize visual effects , bright colors in the advertisements to make people believe that your product is better . This is because when people see the advertisement of your product - say , on TV - they ca n't help thinking that it really is a product of high quality . This is maybe because advertising is a heavily expensive thing to do . Therefore there is this common fallacy that what is advertised must really be good . To conclude , today 's market conditions require the companies to be competent . Some companies concieve this as a legitimization of unfair competition and behave in ways that they create misconceptions in consumers ' minds . Especially when they are advertizing their products . However if they want to create brand-loyal customers they should firstly earn their trust .",TUR," There are many different forms of marketing and maybe the most efficient and widely-used form of it is advertising .

"(HIN) It often happens in schools and colleges that students do not understand some topic and so cram it up and often forget it during the exam time . I believe it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . Ofcourse it is sometimes much easier to just learn pre-stated ideas or established facts then to do reseach on a topic . Take for example , Einstein 's equation of mass and enegy relation : E = m ( c ) 2 . We might just want to learn it as it is in school , rather than try to prove it like Einstien did , because we neither have the time nor the intelligence to prove it at that level . However lack of time or `` Einstein 's brain '' is no excuse to just learn every fact as it is . It is easier to remember information if we try to understand the concept involved in that particular phenomenon . for example , teaching a 5th grade student that `` sun rises in the east '' is okay , but the student should also understand that it rises in the east because earth rotates from west to east in an anti-clockwise manner . When a person tries to understand the ideas and concepts , he questions common beliefs and tries to find answers to questions that pop into his mind thus strengthening his inquisitiveness and improving his knowledge . Understanding a topic , makes it more interesting and make learning easier . it also makes recalling an idea during exams easier . Other than just improving one 's own knowledge , while trying to understand ideas by questioning the common beliefs , one might even make new discoveries . It might make a person curious about a topic or a phenomenon . Besides , craming makes studying boring and monotonous . It reduces our concentration level and thus reduces our efficiency .

"(FRE) On a personnal account , I think that everyone should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . According to me , specializing in one specific subject is extremely dangerous and could undermine the way our societies work . Firstly , I assume that being specialized in a particular academic subject is most harmful to your intellectual skills and the way you think . When you are being taught about a particular subject , you not only learn facts , theories or historical events but you also learn a way of thinking . For instance , learning mathematics will help you develop a rational process of thinking , nonetheless you will not improve your human relations by resolving equations . This could explain why some engineers , with a scientifc cultural background , find difficult to evolve in companies . Secondly , I think that in our developped societies it has become impossible to remain specialized throughout you entire life . Imagine an artist , she has never taken any courses but artistic ones . She founds a galery to expose and sell her works , how will she be able to make it if she has never learnt accountancy or marketing methods ? She will certainly go on bankrupt in a few months . Had she followed management courses , she would have made her gallery flourish . I recognize that society still needs very specialized people . What make things work has become so complex that you cannot hope to succeed if you do not have deep and acurate knowledge . However , extending this specialization to everyone could jeopardize our societies . If people did not share the same knowledege and the same cultural background , they could no longer support themselves and live together . Knowledge creates bounds within people and should always be shared . In conclusion , I assume that knowledge is a precious gift , you have a right to protect it and share it .

It should be presented with examples from different places around the world , related to people with completely different cultural backgrounds . Important facts that changed the course of the history should be given . The first major movement that started in the name of freedom is the French Revolution . It changed the face of the world in a very positive way . This would be an excellent example to explain the fact that freedom is essential for anyone who wants to live his/her life proudly and respectfully .

"(ITA) Success represents a kind of obsession for many people , something that everybody aims in his/her life . And I am one of them too . If we look in a dictionary , we wo n't find an exhaustive explanation of what this word really means , for instance success is a very personal concept that can generically be related to the achievement of something , no matter what it is . But once that you successed in doing or obtaining something , there is for sure something more you want or you tend to . That 's why successful people always look for new challenges . I guess that success can be defined as a kind of adrenaline , a drug , in fact the more successful you are , the more you want to become . For example as I was an outstanding athlete in the practice of judo , I became part of the Italian national team , and even if I should have been satisfied by this sport achievement , I wanted more . Therefore I began to practise many other sports in order to be fit and to demonstrate myself that I was polivalent . But what I have to admitt is that I was terribly attracted by risky activities such as climbing and free-style skiing , and that 's what I eventually did . I think that this attitude of successful people could be compared to mountain trekking , for instance when you reach a peak in the Alps , you are very satisfied , but then you start thinking about the Rocky Mountains , and then to the Andes and then your only desire become to watch the Earth from the Everest . In the end I support the idea that successful people are considered by society successful because they never give up in their ambitions and in their strong will to discover or to achieve in something . That 's maybe why Christopher Columbus discovered America , why we drive cars , why we use mobiles and why it said to be that Armstrong was the first man who did the famous first step on the Moon .",ITA," Success represents a kind of obsession for many people , something that everybody aims in his/her life .

"(HIN) Young people are the fundamental building blocks of any community . They are its foundation , whether it be culturally , politically or even socially . I believe that young people contribute precious time to helping their communities as they are well sensitised to the problems that it faces . The youth of any country is an essential ingredient in the larger matrix of a well-knit community . Young people , through various media and other fora , like television , the internet , are exposed to the grond realities in their community . Education also informs them about the problems plaguing their community , and modes and methods of resolving these problems . For example , by the constructive use of demonstrations and petitions , students in India have been at the vanguard of a silent yet sturdy movement seeking to transform the current status quo of lethargy and sloth in politics into one of efficiency and nimbleness . With the advent of the internet , the young people have found an articulate mouthpiece . They are frequently expressing their opinions through blogs and what have you may . Owing to their adaptive and dynamic nature , the youth has its finger firmly on the community 's pulse . With the rapid pace with which the different forms of communication emerge , the youth are sure to become major shareholders in the future from being mere stakeholders as of now . However , such fervour on part of the youth should be guided by experienced and responsible members of the community . At times , unregulated action by the youth has led to catastrophies .

In conclusion , the youth has done its fair share of community service . In fact , they have been welcome agents of change amidst a sea of senility and inaction by previous generations .

Depending my huge experiences in travelling ( you can call me expert ) , I strongly believe that the best and the funniest way to travel in a small group , preferably close friends who knows each other very well , led by consensus of that group . This short essay will explain why I prefer travelling in a small group is n't led by tour guide and disagree with the given statement in the question .

In these kinds of times , people should spend their times with the friends because in the routine of the life , we share limited times with them . Secondly , buying informative books about the geography , history of the places that we travel is much more accurate information for me than trusting on the knowledge of a tour guide that we do n't know whether or not s/he is expert on the region . Thirdly , travelling in a group that does n't know each other very well may cause irritating problems . For example , last summer I joined a tour to Turkey , led by a tour guide ( unfortunately ! ) and we waited for exactly three hours for a person who was shoppin , ignoring the people who were waiting for her . We lost very valuable hours by only sitting in the bus because our tour guide told us so !! Fourthly , chatting with the people that you are n't gonna see them in the future and wasting your time by listening their childhood or their relationships with their husband/wife is another thing that affect my opion about travelling in a group led by a tour guide .

Last but not least , deciding together with a consensus about what doing next is much more better than taking directives from a tour guide . It is your holiday and somebody tries to decide your schedule . In my view , it is unacceptable .

They want to make a respectable position for themselves in the society and inorder to achieve this they are bending their backs by working hard towards acheiving their goal . This type of thinking by the youngsters is good only upto a certain extent that is upto earning a respectable position in the society , but you have to return something to the the society from which you have taken something and that is your services to the society . In this age of globalisation , getting a job is very easy if you have the qualification for it . Most of the working youngsters want to earn more and and enjoy their free time . They do not care what is happening in their own community , what are the problems and how to resolve these problems all they want to do is to enjoy they do not realise that there is a problem until they face one themselves . None of the youngsters are willing to do social services and most of them are becoming selfish and they are thinking about themselves . Even the society does play a part in not teaching youngsters about social values and ethics . Young people should be taught to help their communities atleast on their holidays with one thing or the other form their childhood . It should be made as a classroom work to help the community for atleast some hours a week .

(TEL) I agree with the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts '' . It is mainly because by understanding the main idea and the concept we can try answer a few questions rather than keep learning the facts . Like for example in Mathematics there are several problems that we go through and there might be many other ways in order to solve these problems . It all depends on the person who is solving the problem . Every person might have a different idea for solving the same problem . For example in a class of 30 students if a question is given and the students are asked to solve that question then all the students might be able to solve the question and also get the answer but the method in which they solve is different . If we just understand how to solve the problem thats more than enough we need not learn the different ways in which we can solve the problems . Just understanding the problem is enough . Even in the exams if we have just started a topic and cant remember even a single thing that we have learned then just understand what that topic is mainly about and write what you have understood about the topic . Another example can be in seminars . We cannot everything and anything that the speaker says on the stage but just understand the main idea and concepts that are being covered in the seminar . In this way it will be easy for us to understand the seminar topic in a better way and if have any doubts also they can be clarified . If the main idea of the problem is understood then everything else is easy to handle . So it is definitely better for us to just understand the ideas and concepts instead of learning the facts . Sometimes it might be too late for us to learn facts about something rather to understand the main ideas and concepts about the same thing . Like in the example of exams we cannot learn everything and remember everything while we are writing the exam . Instead it is better that we understand the main idea and concept of the topic . In this way we can remember the topic for a longer time and can also recollect points about that particular topic where ever it is needed for us to and also give our opinions about the topic . So in my opinion `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts '' . So it is better for a student to understand the main idea of the problem and work towards that problem rather than sit and learn about the problem .

"(SPA) The statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today '' is very strong . I disagree with it because we do not really know what could happen in the future to change our minds in that way , it would be a very radical change .

The distance between our home and the place where we want to go makes us to use the car . For example , we are 4 adults in my family and we have more that one car , and every day each one use our own car to our daily live . Spain is a small country in comparison to others . But it does not mean that we use less the car . Thus , I could imagine what happens in the big countries , where distances between tow points are bigger , everyone use their own car because is faster and you do not need to wait for public transport . I know that this actitud does not help the environment , it causes a lot of pollution to the atmosphere . But every day , in our comunity , we listen the advice to leave the car at home and use public tranport , and we still use our own car , we do not care about the pollution if we need to use the car . It is more confortable for us . Another inconvenience of using the car is the lack of parking in the city , but the local goverbent is building new parkings to solve this problem .

Thus , I could imagine what happens in the big countries , where distances between tow points are bigger , everyone use their own car because is faster and you do not need to wait for public transport . I know that this actitud does not help the environment , it causes a lot of pollution to the atmosphere . But every day , in our comunity , we listen the advice to leave the car at home and use public tranport , and we still use our own car , we do not care about the pollution if we need to use the car . It is more confortable for us . Another inconvenience of using the car is the lack of parking in the city , but the local goverbent is building new parkings to solve this problem . Then I do not think that this problem could make that people use less their own cars . I know that there are negative effects of using my car but I prefer to feel confortable , to arrive quickly to my destiny ( work , party ... ) and it also allow us to be more independent .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER

Therefore , they are afraid of having trouble and have no way to ask for help . With the advanced technology , it cannot be easier to find information about the place you plan to visit .

When you are shopping , you just need to know the price and you just simply look at price tags . When you are ordering food , you just need to know what is on the menu .

"(GER) The statement can be seen from two sides . First , it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts within lectures because without this understanding the context of a lecture would not be kept in mind of the students . In my opinion the lecture has the task to help the students understanding ideas and concepts of the topics they are taught in . On the other hand the lecture at university can not be compared with a lecture in school . In school the teacher has the task to work so long on one topic until the whole class understood everything . In university the professors or lecturers have to help the students getting the ideas and concepts but the students have to keep in mind that they have to work at home additive for the lecture and maybe the lecture only helps them to understand ideas and concepts . Second , it is also very important for students to learn facts because in business they need these facts daily and to have a profound knowledge hard facts have to be included .

"(HIN) I agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important for students than facts . An important purpose of learning is to develop one 's cognitive abilities as well as to develop one 's powers of understanding and analyzing patterns of events or facts . A number of experts also develop the cognition and the ability to predict events or results in the future by extrapolating information or facts on these theories and patterns . The physical sciences are based upon testing of hypotheses and development of theory . Specific facts are not an important feature in their learning . The social sciences too are increasingly getting inclined towards developing theories and concepts . For example , students of History study past civilisations including their rise and fall across regions and time . They come across a lot of details about each of the events and features that characterizes the various developments through History . However , it is important for them to understand the patterns , ideas and the reasons of these events rather than the nitty-gritty details of the events per se . They are taught to identify similarity in patterns of rise and fall of civilisations rather than the exact dates for each of the events or specifics of historical artefacts and culture . Similarly , students of Economics study various economic systems that have existed across countries and through various periods of time . They seldom memorize detailed economic indicators of each of these systems . Rather , they study and learn the principles these economies were based upon , the patterns of their growth and the causes of their rise or fall , as the case may be .

Thus for the learning to be useful in this case , knowledge of facts is not important , understanding economic ideas and concepts are .",HIN," I agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important for students than facts . An important purpose of learning is to develop one 's cognitive abilities as well as to develop one 's powers of understanding and analyzing patterns of events or facts . A number of experts also develop the cognition and the ability to predict events or results in the future by extrapolating information or facts on these theories and patterns . The physical sciences are based upon testing of hypotheses and development of theory . Specific facts are not an important feature in their learning . The social sciences too are increasingly getting inclined towards developing theories and concepts . For example , students of History study past civilisations including their rise and fall across regions and time . They come across a lot of details about each of the events and features that characterizes the various developments through History . However , it is important for them to understand the patterns , ideas and the reasons of these events rather than the nitty-gritty details of the events per se . They are taught to identify similarity in patterns of rise and fall of civilisations rather than the exact dates for each of the events or specifics of historical artefacts and culture .

"(HIN) I disagree with the argument that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years down the line than there are today . I can attribute a number of reasons to support my agreement of argument . The most important reason I consider is the recent technological advances to use non-conventional enery sources instead of conventional fuels like gasoline and diesel . Although I agree that there is decrease in quantity of oil pools one can find out whcih are used to produce petroleum which in turn is used to extract gasoline and diesel , the main fuels that run cars today . Further , scarcity of petroleum has lead to an exponential increase in the growth of petroleum product prices which directly affet the consumption of the product . We can see in the current times , petrol prices are rising at brisk rate and the trend will follow in the future also because of the limited availablity of petroleum resources . However , there are steps taken by companies , independent researcher to look for the non-conventional resources of enery like hydrogen , electricity as future fuels of cars but the experiments have not been successful commercially . I am sure that twenty years time is considerarably good amount of time that the non-conventional sources of energy will completely replace the exisiting conventional fuels . I assume that non-conventional fuels will replace the existing fuel technology in the future because they are easy to use , pollution-free . Automobile manufacturing companies like GM , Toyota etc. are looking forward to welcome these new non-conventional fuels and their research and development groups are persistently working on prototypes which are small boxes that can easily be replaced in existing cars . Existence of this box will imply that we can just have this new box fitted and use different fuel and there is no need to change the car .

"(ITA) I do n't think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . It can be very convenient , of course : for example you do n't have to think about anything ( for instance car hiring , hotels , restaurants , museum tickets ... ) ; you simply sit down in the bus and enjoy the trip . Furthermore , the guide is supposed to know everything about the places you visit and so she ( or he ) can tell you interesting stories about , as well . At the same time , though , travelling in a group led by a guide has a lot of disadvantages that , according to me , are not worthy . First of all , you have to respect a strict and not flexible timetable ; you ca n't choose what you want to visit or where you want to eat , for example . Usually during tours there are thousands of things to do ( and some of them pretty awkward ) so you do n't have enough time to enjoy the places you see along the way ; in many cases you have just the time to get off the bus , take a picture and go back to the bus again . Then , having to follow this strict plan , you ca n't ask to stop when you see something you think is really nice , even to take a picture . And , above all , you can stop to go to the toilet just when the plan tells that you are allowed to ! Sometimes you are obliged to do things you do n't like , as well .

"(HIN) I do not think that traveling in a group lead by a tour idea is a great idea . While many would point to the benifits of having a seasoned , knowledgable resource who understands the lay of the land , the local language and is familiar with all the places and facts in the area , the idea of traveling in a tour group definitely does not appeal to me . My personal experiences have not been very good with tours led by tour guides . First , the guided tours try to squeeze as much in as possible and as such the schedules are very gruelling and tough and one does not get to enjoy the things one wants to do . It is not always easy to tailor a trip that suits everyone 's requirements . Human beings are different and have different preferences , for example someone interested in art may want to visit London only for its museums whereas someone else may prefer to go to London primarily for its fabulous shopping . It would be very difficult to tailor a tour that keeps both these interests at heart and the outcome maybe a combination which satisfies neither . Secondly , there is always the factor of control and independence , an impulsive side trip or extended stay may not be an option on these tours . Imagine being worn out from a trek up the hill to see a castle and not having the ability to turn back to go to the Hotel because the tour bus has a schedule to see five more places . Finally , there is the question of lodging and dining choices . Individual tastes are very diverse and since its is very difficult to cater to the tastes of different individuals the tour guides may choose the least common denominator which again will leave many dissatisfied . To summarize I would not recommend guided tours as a way to travel on account of problems you may face due to the reasons highlighted above .",HIN," I do not think that traveling in a group lead by a tour idea is a great idea .

Because the world has changed radically over the past hundred years more jobs are provided and more people are getting really involved with this development . As a result , speed became a very important matter in an individual 's life . Since , more work is needed to be accomplished by an individual now than it probably was before and in a shorter amount of time , an individual might find himself or herself in need for shortcuts and methods than makes his or her life easier . When we go to our jobs or schools or anywhere else we usually try to save time and reach there as quickly as possible . The most popular method of doing that is driving a vehicle or being driven in a vehicle . More and more people are finding themselves in great need of a car . In some families , more than just one car is neccessary . So , if you go into a house of a family consisting of six members for example , you will most probably find two cars or even more . In some families both the parents could have jobs and therefore , each one of them needs his or her own car . Another reason is that people have more chances of buying a car or even more today , which is because so many car companies make it easy for customers .

With people getting busier by the day and chances of buying a car increasing , and speed becoming such a vital thing , I believe that in the next twenty years cars will not only not decrease , but they will increase and the numbers of cars will sore .",ARA," To predict what will happen in twenty years from now is a hard thing to do .

"(ITA) I completely disagree with the wiew that young people do not spend enough time helping their communiy . In fact I believe that the most active members of communities are young people . Community needs are varied , and not are not just limited to helping out elderly people , or servicing in hospitals , or other typically welfare duties . Nonetheless many of the young people I know spend much of their spare time volunteering on ambulances , or performing plays and music for elderly , thus contributing significantly to the total amount of time spent by the communty in general on these tasks , and often being the promoters of such activities . On top of this I am firmly convinced that communities need spaces and occasions on which to gather , in order to strenghten their mutual ties , to get to know each other better , thus exchanging culture and knowledge . It is my experience that young people are the best and the more commited to organize such events . In fact many of the art displays in my community are organized , and kept running by people in their twenties ; and often the works displayed are also made by young people . This shows that young people are helpful to their community in two different ways : they both organize cultural events and are the main cultural point of reference and innovation in the community . I also know a lot of youngsters involved in politics , both trhough political parties and political associations . I have been in a political association for many years too . In the meetings that were frequently held , important topics regarding our city and province were usually discussed and debated , and often innovative and revolutionary ideas were developed , some of which were later successfully implemented by the local authorities . Moreover an advancement in political and social beliefs will not be possible without the fundamental partecipation of young people to public life .

In fact I believe that the most active members of communities are young people . Community needs are varied , and not are not just limited to helping out elderly people , or servicing in hospitals , or other typically welfare duties . Nonetheless many of the young people I know spend much of their spare time volunteering on ambulances , or performing plays and music for elderly , thus contributing significantly to the total amount of time spent by the communty in general on these tasks , and often being the promoters of such activities . On top of this I am firmly convinced that communities need spaces and occasions on which to gather , in order to strenghten their mutual ties , to get to know each other better , thus exchanging culture and knowledge . It is my experience that young people are the best and the more commited to organize such events . In fact many of the art displays in my community are organized , and kept running by people in their twenties ; and often the works displayed are also made by young people .

"(TEL) The statement is In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . One group of people agree with this statement and one group of people donot agree with the statement . I find many reasons for not agreeing with the statement . I personally donot agree with the statement . Yes , technology is developing day by day but this does not necessarily mean that there will be no cars in twenty years . This is unpredictable . Now a days people are working hard and are making their lives comfortable that is they are acquiring everything they need . What makes life more comfortable ? the answer is having more luxuries and having more comforts . People are more concentrating on luxuries which includes mobiles for communication , vehicles that is cars , bikes for transport , own houses for living and so on . So people buy vehicles bikes , scooters , cars etc . Most luxurious of all is Car . Not only luxurious , it is safer than many other vehicles . So buying cars will definitely increase that is there will be many cars in use in twenty years . These reasons donot support with the statement . secondly , people are trying to reach the goals above their standards . For example a person using a two wheeler vehicle , even though it is hard for him to buy a car , keeps his goal of buying a car due to various reasons . Some of them are for avoiding pollution and accidents . They feel having a car is far better than having other vehicles . The main reason is Car is affordable .

For all these reasons which are discussed above , i donot agree with the statement that fewer cars will be in use than there are today .

"(GER) Over the past centuries , pedagogues all over the world have been discussing whether it is more effective for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn the facts about things . This debate has not been won by one side or the other and one can only state a personal preference on it . Personally , I think that a child or student will gain more from understanding ideas and concepts and from being able to apply this knowledge than by a mere memorisation of facts . To learn facts often means to memorise something written in a textbook or something heard during a lecture . But how effective can this process be ? Will it enable the student to apply what s/he has learned ? I do not think that this is the case . I went to University in Italy where the school ( and university ) system is still based on memorisation and in my experience , students there will learn facts , memorize them until their exam is due and then forget about them . In most of the cases , they were not able to apply what they have learned . An example : they were very good in the subject of English grammar , knew the difference between all four German cases , but when it came to speak English or German , they would not be able to pronounce a correct phrase . The learning of facts can often be very boring . The student has to concentrate to memorize something s/he might not even understand ; often it is a theory that s/he can not relate to . To learn the facts is important because it gives the student necessary background information , but it is much more fun for a student to discover some facts for him/herself . In a kindergarden class , the kids would definitely be more interested to have a frog in their classroom , to observe the animal and learn about it this way than by reading about it in a textbook . They would understand much better what the teacher is talking about if they can experience it in person . Of course it is important to learn facts . But in my opinion it is a traditional , rigid way of learning that often does not respect the inborn curiosity of ( young ) students . Like in many other cases , a mixture between both theories would be a good solution . First , the facts should be told . Then ideas and concepts should be understood by the student , so that s/he can apply what s/he has learnt earlier . After all , life is not just about facts , but about the ideas and concepts that lay beneath these facts as well .",GER," Over the past centuries , pedagogues all over the world have been discussing whether it is more effective for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn the facts about things .

"(SPA) I agree with this statement . The reason why I think succesful people are those who try new and take chances has to do with this behaviour being the more suitable for adaptation . Before I adress how these actions may serve adaptive purposes , we need to accept that life in modern society , in old society and even in most biological systems ( to cut to the chase ) is one of constant change . In light of the constant changes in everday problems and necesities , the lack of hability to try new things - or to be inovative - will invariably leave us lagged behind , uncapable to cope with even the most basic challenges . For instance , imagine an alarm company that decides not to change their sales stategies because the long time way of `` doing it well '' was knocking door by door to offer their services directly into the costumers face . In the era of internet shopping for just about everything , this strategie would have foretold the collapse of the alarm selling times of this company . To point out on the need to take risks , this company , in the begining of the 70's or 80's would have had to start taking chances training their workers in the use of computers and comunications technology . It may have seemed incredible back then , that in 20 years a substancial amout of people would be purchasing just about everthing sitting in front of a screen in the comfort of their oun homes . But , what might haved seemed like takeing a huge risk , had to be done .

"(ARA) The statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' is very true in my opininion . First , if this sentence is taken and placed in a political context , many examples appear that illustrate the truthfulness of the sentence . For example , the late president Sadat of Egypt introduced a new economic program to the country called `` infitah '' in Arabic and which means `` to be open '' in English . This program was new to the country because it involved open trade with any country in the world , unlike the old system which was a socialist or a closed trade system . That system had many critics at the time it was adopted but Sadat took the risk and implemented the program which turned to be a great economic success for the country . Second , the statement is true when looking at it from a business point of view . For example , Bill Gates , the owner of Microsoft , tried a lot of new things and invented a lot of software that turned out to be very successful although there were great risks for its failure at the begininning . Moreover , the word `` innovation '' is used by many businesses nowadays to illustrate thier belief in new things and anything new must have great risks at first .

Therefore , the business enviroment believes that new things lead the way for profit and thus success .

A student who works in a compeny for a summer job . he usually get lost of solutions of many different problems from his work . Nevertheless , under some circumstance , if the student just study a lots in college and learns how to understand the ideas and the consepts he will just solve problem as what he learn from the ideas and consept he got in college and some people may feel they are week . It should be potantially harfuml or at least unprodictable , in his carrea . Sencondly , an arguement can be present my idea is that every people have to learn facts in theri lifes . It is obvious that people even can live without learn some ideas and consepts . A good example can give some lights to this point . the old man always tell his young the fact that he has learn , which means that the facts is more important for the young and for the student . However , to the contraries , nowadays we can see that lots of university student more difficult to get the jod than the college students just because colleges consider facts are importantfor students to learned .

"(FRE) In my opinion i believe that young people do enjoy their life more than older people . they have the opportunity to go to parties , make a lot of friends and do all fun activities they want to that older people ca n't do . young people can do all kind of fun and interesting things like me i enjoy parties a lot with my friends . but i am more focus in my school work . when i am doing my school work i found it is fun and i am enjoying doing it . when you are young what is when life is started , that the time you going to do everything for when you get older . because when you are old you defenitely ca n't do the same thing you use to do when you were young . it 's the time to take a rest looking back in your present . i encourage all young people to enjoy their life while they are young because once you get old you will regret that you did n't enjoy your life , you will feel that you miss something that you should have done before and you can not done when you older . so do n't let all the great opportunities pass by and after to feel bad about them . however when i was a child i did n't like people who like to go to parties , movies , have fun or anything because my mom always tell me to stay home , go to school only and never have fun . but now when i get older i realize it was a good advantage for me to enjoy my life while i was younger than when i am getting older . it 's also help you to get ride of stress , make your life easier and help you stay and live longer .",FRE," In my opinion i believe that young people do enjoy their life more than older people . they have the opportunity to go to parties , make a lot of friends and do all fun activities they want to that older people ca n't do . young people can do all kind of fun and interesting things like me i enjoy parties a lot with my friends . but i am more focus in my school work . when i am doing my school work i found it is fun and i am enjoying doing it . when you are young what is when life is started , that the time you going to do everything for when you get older . because when you are old you defenitely ca n't do the same thing you use to do when you were young . it 's the time to take a rest looking back in your present . i encourage all young people to enjoy their life while they are young because once you get old you will regret that you did n't enjoy your life , you will feel that you miss something that you should have done before and you can not done when you older . so do n't let all the great opportunities pass by and after to feel bad about them . however when i was a child i did n't like people who like to go to parties , movies , have fun or anything because my mom always tell me to stay home , go to school only and never have fun . but now when i get older i realize it was a good advantage for me to enjoy my life while i was younger than when i am getting older . it 's also help you to get ride of stress , make your life easier and help you stay and live longer .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(KOR) I disagree with the statement because taking risks is very dangerous and often became very unsuccessful over many years . There are hundreds of companies I never heard of that were founded by a person took risks to make some money . Even though it may sound easy , but it is very complicated : dealing with employments , monthly or yearly payments , government taxes , etc . As the result , only a few companies or even no company will survive . The result makes many people become moneyless or deptors . Taking risks is not a good idea . Trying is not a bad thing , but risking is not a good thing . There are only a few people who succeeded by risking , while there are millions who unsucceeded by risking . That 's why people who only does what they already know how to do well succeeds more often than those who take risks . For example , early pioneers tried to make flying possible for humans . Of course , the inventors succeeded , but the others lost money , wasted time , or even died . But now billions of people fly each year in an airliner or private airplanes . How did that happen ? The manufacturing companies invented better airplanes , based on the early inventors ' designs . In other words , they invented what they already knew how to do well . Then the manufacturing company succeeded , selling thousands of the same model , for the same price , and ending what it 's like today . There are many successful people who tried new things and took risks . But there are more people who succeeded by not taking risks and only doing what they already know how to do well . Like I mentioned earlier , taking risks could change people 's lives in a bad way by making them lose money , or even killing them .

"(GER) This is a very interssting question . The answer to this questions is not easy . After my first thought I do not agree to this statement . In these days almost everybody has his own car . It is very confortable driving in your own car , you do not depend on others or on public transportation . I prefer driving by car , because I can descide spontanious what I would likt to do and where I would like to go . Sometimes it is even cheaper driving by car , than taking public transportation , like bus or train . While going on vacation , you can also descide using the bus , train , plain or even your car . Mostly it is cheaper driving by car . These are some examples why driving cars are could be better than using public transportation . We are not allowed to forget : Technologie is rising very fast these days . At the moment the automobile industrie ist trying to develop a motor , that does not spend gas . They are looking for different kind of ressources . The plan is to keep cars , but make them work with electric or solar energy for example . So if they spend another 5 years on developping a new motor for cars , i do not think they will be able find different sources for transportations besides cars so fast . Reasons for cars getting fewer and fewer in the future could be the rising prices , not only on cars , but also the oil prices . Driving your own car is already very expensive . First of all you must have enough money to buy the car . That ist not it . You must also plan the costs that are related with buying a car , like taxes , insurance and gas . The gas price has been raised since several years and will probably still rise the next years . This makes car driving even more expensive . So if people start thinking about their money in a more serious matter , they will think about really buying a car or saving the money . But maybe there will be some inventions in the future that will change all our expectations . Maybe we will be able to fly by ourselves in small planes or in some kind of rockets . The imagination is big , the sky is the limit . I could even imagine that nobody will drive cars in 20 years , because we will be flying , not driving anymore . So it really depends on how the development of inventions for the future are . But if everything stays like it is and we keep using our cars as we do now , I do not agree to the statement above . Our population is getting bigger and bigger , the streets are getting fuller and fuller and the car industrie is making more profits than ever !

For example , talking about history , it is easy to learn so many facts about the French Revolution that whenever someone will question you , you will be able to answer with dates , bottles , names etc but if you do not understand the historical background you wo n't be able to understand how much the ideas and concepts developing at that time influenced the beginning of the French Revolution . Another example could be better set by phylosophy , phylosophy is such a complex matter that just knowing the facts means nothing .

"(GER) There were always innovations and people who try something new . There are three reasons why I think that it is important to try new things and to take risks to be successful . First , if people take the risk to sell its new idea they have the possibility to be very successful . New ideas have the characteristic that nowbody else offers this idea or product . For example , Bill Gateshad the idea of a new computer software . He was successful because he was the first who sold his idea and he took the risk of losing all his money . Second , humans always need to develope new products . For example , medicaments for new illnesses . Scholars have to take the risk , that the medicament does not work or causes other illnesses . Before the medicament can be sold to the people it has to be tested for a long time . If the tests are not successful , the work of the scholars is not worth anything . The scholars want to develpe something new and take the risk . Third , new things and innovations are very interresting . People like new electronic devices , dangerous attractions in theatres or shows and new tastes and smells for food or deodorant . Every company that developes a new product has to invest money to invent it . After the company has to pay money for marketing , product placement and so on to sell its product successful . The amount of money the company spends is the risk it takes . But without taking the risk it has to sell its old products but mostly costumers do not want old products . They are only successful if they take the risk and be the first company that offers a new product .

Personally I am often so worried about my future , my job perspectives and so on that I can not sleep in the evening . Older people are more experienced . Although they have got problems , too , they mostly take them easier . They know life goes on . That is why they see the things differently and can enjoy other things than younger people . After years of good and bad times they can analyze situations in another way . If your are young you want to change the world , you are thinking about the big things . When you are getting older your values change . My mother is a good evidence for this . She told me that went on parties as she was younger and that this was her way of enjoying life .

"(HIN) In my openion young people do enjoy life more than older people . This is a very evident fact and can be said based on reasons . Firstly , Younger people have more risk taking and dander facing tendancy than older people . Young people are carefree and more enthuziastic than older people and hence they tend to perform any activity for just the sake of enjoyment . While older people do not have that carefree and risk taking attitude . Older people are much mature and tend to focus more on the danger and possibility of damage or accident that lays ahead . So , younger people many times enjoy themselves by taking up risky sports like car and motor-bike racing , bungy jumping and para-sailing . Secondly , the phsical conditions of older people does not many times allow them to move to different places and perform many fun related activities . While the body of younger people is more flexible and strong so they get less tired . So , they can enjoy by taking up sports , long country tour and other similar activities as a source of enjoyment for themselves . Also , young people are more flexible an adaptable towards the changes in the culture and in technology and hence more by going to a disco , pub , getting tattoos , playing games on computer and using various eletronic items like i-pods and mp3 player . Lastly , though it is possible for older people to enjoy life but they are not able to enjoy as much as younger people due to other limitations . Older people have many responsibilities of family , work and society on them . So , they are not able to enjoy themselves as much as young people who are free from these responsibilities and have much more time to enjoy .

"(TEL) Most people love to travel to different places . the question here is whether we have to go alone by ourselves or to go by a group that will led by a tour guide . my opinion is to travel in a group led by a tour guide . i agree to this and i will explain you about my opinion . First if you think you are going by yourselves . you only planned the trip . your hotel bookings everything was done through internet . even though you listed the visiting sites from the internet . if you travel to that place with out the tour guide , that trip thats not at all going to be fun why because travel guide knows the history of each and every place we are going to visit . he will explain in you detail . if any thing happens to you like if you will be sick suddenly what will happen you just imagine this kind of situation . second is travel in a group that will be led by tour guide . there are many advantages . fisrt thing is in a group means you surely will have lot of fun . travel guide takes to different places , he will explain the history of those visiting places . one more thing he will fix the timings like at what time you have to get up ? , at what time you have to leave one place and go to another place . so you wont have much tension about this planning . travel guide will take care of all these . one more thing is we will get lot of concessions in lodging because as we are going by a group and travel guide might be knowing some familiar hotels , where he will get some concessions obviously amount of money we need to pay will be less . one important thing if suddenly we will be sick he will arrange us to go to the hospital as we are new to that place being a travel guide he might have known all the places and facilities what we will get . As there is a saying in english '' EVERY COIN HAS TWO SIDES '' . there are advantages and disadvantages but my advantages out weigh the disadvantages .

"(CHI) There is on doubt that , young people play as an ever-increasing important role in our society , because they are more creative , active and vigorous than adult people in many aspects . However , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . First of all , young people nowadays pay too much attention on their study . Because of the more and more competitive educational circumstance , young people are indused to spend a great deal of time on study and preparing for exams , decreasing their concerning about other things such as family chore , community activities , to name a few . For instance , my community holds a feast festival on the moon festival every september ; unfortuneately , the date is close to young students ' mid-exam , there are very few young people helping to organize the feast , not to mention attending the feast . Moreover , in the recent decades , people tend to have only one or two children in each family ; accordingly , young people nowadays do not have many siblings to get along with . The phenomenon leads them to more self-centered individuals , rather than team-work persons . They care much more about themselves , such as school achievement , personal pleasure and interests , evaluation from peers ; namely , some public affairs like community service is not likely to draw their attention . To conclude , young people indeed plays an important role in our society in that they are the future generation , and what they tend to be meaningfully influence what our world is going to be . I believe that young people are more intelligent and creative than adult people ; also , they are sure to make our world better . But , if young people can concern more about public affairs to learn the spirit about teamwork , contribution and mutual help , they can contribute to our world much more , since our modern society cannot operate through independant individuals , but cooperation .",CHI," There is on doubt that , young people play as an ever-increasing important role in our society , because they are more creative , active and vigorous than adult people in many aspects .

One of the important improvement of technology is the invent of cars . Cars were made to shorten the distance between two places , and it might be the most successful invent ever .

Many governments nowadays strongly encourage people to use the public transforming system such as bus , train , or even airplane . In addition , many countries encourage their people walk and bike instead of driving . Certainly , the governments have this kind of suggestions is to prevent from more polutions that are caused by cars . I believe humen around the world will soon realize the purpose of governments having these suggestions , and will stop buying cars in order to avoid more polutions that are cause by cars . Another reason of why the numbers of cars will decrease in twenty years is because the heavy traffic that is happening to all the big cities in moderndays . If humen are still buying more and more cars , can you imagine what will happen in the future ? The situation of traffic will be terrible for sure .

"(CHI) I would agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . There is a saying that `` Experience is the best teacher '' . A person who is very successful must experience more in different ways and learn how to survive in different environment and not afraid of risks . I will explain my opoins from the following aspects . First of all , one of the most important character that a successful person should have is curiousity and a desire about learning new things . Normally a new opportunity , new atmosphere and new people around can bring new sense and new pentientail for a person . For example , a very famous Chinese writer Lu Xun . He used to be a doctor , but he realized that doctor can only treat people 's sick instend of thinking . So tried to start writing article and book , then his books influenced a generation of Chinese in 1920s . Secondly , as a successful person , he must be very brave and taking risks in all different circumstances . For example , Chairman Mao is a tipical successful leader who was always taking risks in this world . He led Chinese people to stand up and build a new country in the east Asia . Thirdly , I do n't think that a person who always keeps a position and never try new things in his life will be successful . Keeping doing one thing for long time , people will become lazy and increative . They just want to do the daily things and never think about do some different from others . On the other hand , I also think that persistance is an very important character that a successful person should have . For example , a scientist is doing lots of study and research focusing on specific fields and progects . The job itself requires that he must know how to deal with his study and also must know how to do well . It is essencial for a scientist that he must be pacient and concentrate on something instead of trying new things and taking risks .

Secondly : what means nowadays ? Has there really been at time when this ever worked out properly ? The answer of this question touches the first aguement i want to talk about . Of course there has been a change of the situations and the meaning of communities in the western world during the twentieth century . One aspect certainly is the strong increase of the density of population inducing a growth of communities . By becoming bigger and more complex they lost their athmosphere of a defined neighbourhood , whicht definately determined the people `` s attitude towards their communtiy .

In the other words . there are several teams and sub-organizations classified in a firm . it does not need one who has got narrow knowledge .

However , I do not compeletly agree with their opinion because you can earn money so easily and you can announce your name to the world .

For example , there are many doctor in the world . But there was few doctors who can use gene freely even though many patients who have problem about gene are looking for the expert doctors to recover their health . So the proffesional doctors can earn the money easlier than non proffesinal doctors . Therefore it is important to study one subject in this society . Next , we should live our life very meaningful because a person can live only one time , So we will be a expert one subject and then our name are announced to the whole world . For instance , prof.

"(GER) Basically , I agree to this statement . To understand ideas and concepts is more complicated than just learning things by heart , and this is also what academic courses try to teach their students . Being able to present own ideas is more worth than just re-producing things , like you do if you learn hard facts . That 's why I think that doing research or developing or understanding ideas and concepts should rewarded higher than simply reproducing thing . Science could not work without any ` thinking ' , and that is what students at a school or especially at an university are supposed to learn : To get behind the things . Furthermore , most facts are based upon a concept . That is an additional reason why understanding or doing science is more worth than just learning something by heart . On the other hand , it is mandatory to have a huge knowledge about simple facts in certain areas .

Several official reports stated that the product contained alarmingly high levels of pesticides , while the company continued to broadcast an advertisement which said that the drink had 0 % pesticides and was perfectly safe for human consumption . Another advertisement was once brodcasted about a stock market fund . It stated almost nothing about the risks involved in the investment , but only a very fine print at the bottom saying `` this investment is subject to market risks , please read the offer document carefully before investing '' . The only thing it showed was celebrities saying that they would invest in the fund as they felt it right . This is only a few of of many examples that a lot of people experience .

"(HIN) I completely agree with the statement . According to me , Success cannot be acheived by a particular formula or a so called tried and tested method . To become successful you need to have your own new or derived set of ideas that you think will make you successful . If you have to acheive great success you have to come up with new ideas otherwise you will lose or at the maximum be moderately successful . For eg. We all know about the `` easy '' group which is headed by Mr. Stelios . When he tried to venture in Cruise business there were preset notions and fixed rules like the Ship had to be always be on Sea and all the luxuries of life were to be enjoyed there . Moreover , the average age of Cruise goer was in 50's . Stelios completely revamped this strategy and brought his ideas . His prime area of thinking was that the cruise should attract younger people . So he developed his own way by bringing in new concept of low cost travel and also halts at prime locations . The Cruise took stop at places like Monte Carlo during F-1 racing which is a very expensive place to stay . Thus it can be said that Stelios did venture into risks and tried new things in which he was successful . If you to survive in the competitive world of today you need to try new things because there are large number of people who are goin to do the same old things that they know .

"(TUR) The humankind always should invent and use new products to be the modern person therefore using new products is an impotant aspect in humankind 's life because it could harm the humankind . I personally do n't agree with idea of making the product advertisements much better than they really are . These are my following reasons . First of all , The humankind always need to intelligent in different situations but not selling the bad product with a very nice advertisement to sell more than they plan to . All the people would like the product advertisements which are most of lie . For example , I have listened and watched to an advertisement of a new toothpaste that showing the new product as a very efficient thing for your mouth health . But when I had listened to the radio I have figured out that the new product is a just typical toothpaste that do n't have any additional ingredients rather than the regular toothpastes . In my opinion Humankind should do more important things that could develop our generation rather than selling typical products with good advertisements . In addition to this , The humankind should'nt believe to the advertisements that are not lying on proofs , For example , A person wants to buy a shampoo that he has got used to but he sees a new product that is the half price of the shampoo he got used to , Would n't he just try out once because of the price no matter his or her budget is . In my opinion we all do try it once before we buy the product wer used to buy . This is a very efficient point that a lot of people have been missing or ignoring . Not only the money but also the power of it could do whatever the product owners do . For example , Have you ever seen an expensive new product in markets . The new products are always the products which are cheaper than a dozen . The last but at least is that the most important thing we should not ignore is education level of the people because of believing the new product 's advertisements . It has been always a stereotype that the cheap new products have no difference with regular products . In my opinion if the humankind needs and wants to reach higher , they should educate the people rather than telling them lies about unnecessary product advertisements . Not only this generation or the next but also a lot of generation is going to live in this world . That 's why we should start to change our attitudes to reach higher . I 'm not telling that people should not do things such as these advertisements , They should do with in a circle of limits . All in all as I said before , Humankind have more important things than making advertisements for new products to make them better than they really are with advertisements which could be the most efficient aspect to catch people 's eye on .

"(JPN) I agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do becouse there are two main points of my view about agreement . These are that young people enjoy their life in technological way and social way . First of all , recently , the technology wich surround our life astonishingly immproved a lot . Several decade ago , noone could imagin how the technology develop like now generation . Older people 's activity was limitted due to unsufficient technology of their lives . Back in their day , they had to use old style technology to accomplish their purposes , in contrust , it was n't efficient . It took more time and energy than now . It mean , older people 's enjoyable time was robbed by efforting . On the other hand , new technology has very high quality . It succeeded cutting off wasty time to do something compare with older people did . So , younger people can afford to having a good time as spending the time to their hobby and thing witch they has interest .

These are that young people enjoy their life in technological way and social way . First of all , recently , the technology wich surround our life astonishingly immproved a lot . Several decade ago , noone could imagin how the technology develop like now generation . Older people 's activity was limitted due to unsufficient technology of their lives . Back in their day , they had to use old style technology to accomplish their purposes , in contrust , it was n't efficient . It took more time and energy than now . It mean , older people 's enjoyable time was robbed by efforting . On the other hand , new technology has very high quality . It succeeded cutting off wasty time to do something compare with older people did . So , younger people can afford to having a good time as spending the time to their hobby and thing witch they has interest .

"(TEL) On a first glance it may sound politically correct to say that it is better to have a broader perspective on many subjects rather than specializing in a field . But I feel that it is better to specialize in a field , though a field that interests the person to a great extent . In olden days when there was no technology to aid the humans , they accumulated whatever information they had on a particular field . But ultimately the information was not massive . That is , the information was not of that quantum that it was difficult for the brain to remember . Lets looks at todays picture . We know of the advances made in every field of academics . There is so much to learn and know , but is the human brain capable of that ? I dont think so . So it is actually a human shortcoming . Now , from another point of view . The most common example of a doctor ! We all know that specialists are an absolute essentiality these days . The reason for an improved life longevity is not only the machines ( i.e. technology ) but also humans in the form of specialists . As a specialist knows his field very well he can deal with almost all the situations arising from his field and this ultimately means greater services to the people . Although people tend to argue that due to so many branches in every field it might become a case of `` too many cooks spoil the broth '' . But , because to the special fields , the specialist may concentrate more on his field and and work hard to improve his field of work , that is again , better results ! We have many such examples in every field today . For example , had every engineer been building bridges and houses ( like earlier ) , would there be fields of engineering such as robotics and nano particles ? But , finally as an exception , it must be left to the individual concerned . This is because there is a natural tendency in some people to learn everything they like , they are inquisitive . So it is better to leave the choice to such people . Of course , ultimately knowledge is also for pleasure and self contentment !

They are least with the responsibilities and in turn have a handful time to put in something interesting and adventerous . Other major reason for young to enjoy is that young age is considered to be the `` age of moulding '' , thus he tries to learn more and more of the things which in itself is an interesting affair because gaining anything new is always fun , even though at times it might be leading to the wrong side of the track , but here we are discussing about enjoying life , so anyone in this young age could easily deviate to a path which might be misleading but still enjoying while on the other hand , an old individual is prone to be afraid of going for something new as he has a lot of responsibilities on him and would have to think about it a hundred times before going for it , so he usually sticks to the orthodox schedule which make make him further more reluctant for going for fun filled part .

"(HIN) Accoding to my opinion young people do enjoy life more than old people do . The first reason that supports my opinion is the age factor . Young people are free from troubles or fears that come with old age . Talking about the fear , i mean the fear of death and the fear of physical ailments that come with old age . Although old people are free from the basic responsibilities of life but still they cant enjoy their freedom from responsibilites the way they want or deserve because of thier old age and the problems that come with it . Young people live with energy and a youthful and positive attitude towards life . Even though they have responsibilities and goals to achieve , but still they are always filled with energy and an attitude to achieve what they want from life . This is because they are free from all the barriers that come hand in hand with old age . These barriers discourage old people from enjoying life to the fullest . They are nomore in a mental and physical situation to accept challenges in life . They are not capable of setting goals in life and this inturn keeps them away from the ecstacy and joy of achieving a goal that younger people have the ability to enjoy . Another point of view would be the advancement in technology and the generation gap . The older genration is still suffocating in the claws of orthodox and conservative ideas which also stops them from enjoying life to full extent . They are also unaware of the technological improvements that have taken place and are also not ready to identify with them . They still want to stand by their old orthodox traditions and dont open themselves to the fresh breeze of todays world . They want to keep a closed mind and dont want to breathe in the fresh air of the modern world .

"(ARA) Students around the world have different methods of learning , it highly depends on the subject in hand . Some subjects depend more on learning facts , other subjects are more towards understanding the ideas . I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , and I think that this statement should be applied to all subjects . As a start , by understanding the ideas and concepts , students will end up understanding the subject in hand , not just learning it by heart . Understanding the ideas and concepts will make it much easier for them to learn the details by heart . For instance , in Biology , if you understand the exact route of blood from the heart to the organs , you will find it easier to later on learn the names of the organs that the blood passes through . Moreover , some subjects such as Mathematics , need clear understanding of the concepts so that you could apply them to the questions . After understanding the concepts , you can learn the rules , and then apply them . In addition , it is more easy to forget a subject that you simply learnt , but not quiet understood . In my junior high school years , my worst subject ever was History .

"(FRE) Many people are trying to find the way that leads to a successful life . The proposed theory means that to be successful you have to dare doing new things instead of focusing on what you already know to do well . I do not agree with such a thesis . First , many people are successful only by doing what they know how to do well . If you do things better than others do , you have great chances to succeed in your project . For instance , a lot of sport champions only focus on their sport and do not lose time besides . For example , Roger Federer , the current best tennis player in the world , was learnt tennis since he was very young and went on in this way which lead him to success . Whereas a lot of well known singers who tried to play in films did not manage in this way and went back to what they did well . Neverlethess , many amazing success story happened to people who tried to do something new . For instance , the famous former tennis player Yannick Noah , after a good carrier as a tennis player , has become a very famous singer . Consequently , if I do not really agree with the thesis I have to acknowledge that it is possible to be successful in other field that the one you are meant to . So , my point is that even if you are doing well in something , this does not mean that you can do well eslewhere . On the contrry , I think that people who have been successful in the field they were prepared for have better chances to have great achivements in others fields because they have been learnt how to commit in a project , to be professional and to believe in themselves .",FRE," Many people are trying to find the way that leads to a successful life .

As far as I am concerned , I think that travelling in a group led by a a tour guide is too much better than travelling alone without a guide . This is due to various reasons . A reason why it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide is that it is safer . When you travel to a new place , You probably do not know too much about it . Thus , if you travel without having a tour guide , you can get lost . Also , you might not know the language of the foreign country , so you will not be able to ask about directions . Moreover , if you are in trouble , you can not ask for help because you do not know who to ask and you do not know the language . Another reason is that it is more relaxing to travel in a group led by a tour guide . You do not have to worry about what to do next or how to spend your time . The tour guide will plan everything for you . All you have to do is to enjoy your time and take photos . It is certainly easier and helps you make better use of your time .

Generally speaking , it is easier for young people to complete , as compared as older people . Additionally if they could not carry heavy baggage like older people , the areas where they could go is limited or they have to pay money to make someone carry . Older people will not go around .

"(SPA) Although a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting , I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons . Firstly , if a person is focused in a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge , because it is his or her election and probably he or she really likes that field . Moreover , specialization is very important when you are a job seeker , particullarly when you are looking for your first job . There is not any chance for people knowing many things in a superficial view ; oit is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field . I can concide that a broad knowledge is useful sometimes , for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff . But that is not usually the common case because most of the people work in medium or large companies . Thus , the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leaders is quite higher than the number of leaders itself . Usually a general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be insert . We can consider also this dilemma is the history . If the modern society have promoted the broad knowledge more than the specialized one , it would have been impossible such a fantastic development . In summary , although a broad knowledge is necessary sometimes , society had better promote deeper knowledge in the challenges that we are facing , and for that the specialization must be a priority .",SPA," Although a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a person very interesting , I really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reasons .

"(CHI) There is not doubt that whether young people enjoy more than old people do has become more controversial in today 's modern socity . As a matter of fact , this issue deals with a lof of different aspects . Specifically , there are no universal answers to this question . Depending on different elements such as social influence , personal interest , education background and etc , the answers of different people may vary greatly . As far as I am concerned , I vote that yong people do not enjoy life more than old people . In the following paragraphs , I would like to explicte my view from several perspectives . In the first place , the important reason in support of my view is that young people encounter more or at least the same amount of the physical problems than the older people do . Both scientifc study and empirical experience show us that physical problems are in propotional to the technologies levels . Therefore , with these problems , young people have to deal with these new problems before they can enjoy their life , namely , they will not have the same opportunies to enjoy life . For example , with the Internet invention , young people have to deal with all the techincal problems in constrcting the network or in maintaining the network . But , for those older people , they can enjoy their life without thinking how this new monster brings about the c . In the second place , young peole have to bear more social burdens than the olde people . Social burdens manifest themselves in terms of social changes . For today 's young people , let 's say in china , the society is pentrating into an aging society . With One Child Policy , the country will say one young couple have to sustain at least four parents or their family members . Accordingly , young people can not have much time to enjoy life as the older people do . In the third place , admittedly , young people could face more opportunites to leave a happy life , for example , the joy that Internet brings us .

In conclusion , the topic that whether young people enjor life more than older people do will be continuously argued . However , as the comprehensive stuy discussed above , I can safely draw the conclusion that young people do not enjoyb life more than older people do .",CHI," There is not doubt that whether young people enjoy more than old people do has become more controversial in today 's modern socity . As a matter of fact , this issue deals with a lof of different aspects . Specifically , there are no universal answers to this question . Depending on different elements such as social influence , personal interest , education background and etc , the answers of different people may vary greatly . As far as I am concerned , I vote that yong people do not enjoy life more than old people . In the following paragraphs , I would like to explicte my view from several perspectives . In the first place , the important reason in support of my view is that young people encounter more or at least the same amount of the physical problems than the older people do . Both scientifc study and empirical experience show us that physical problems are in propotional to the technologies levels . Therefore , with these problems , young people have to deal with these new problems before they can enjoy their life , namely , they will not have the same opportunies to enjoy life . For example , with the Internet invention , young people have to deal with all the techincal problems in constrcting the network or in maintaining the network . But , for those older people , they can enjoy their life without thinking how this new monster brings about the c . In the second place , young peole have to bear more social burdens than the olde people . Social burdens manifest themselves in terms of social changes . For today 's young people , let 's say in china , the society is pentrating into an aging society . With One Child Policy , the country will say one young couple have to sustain at least four parents or their family members . Accordingly , young people can not have much time to enjoy life as the older people do . In the third place , admittedly , young people could face more opportunites to leave a happy life , for example , the joy that Internet brings us . Some people , accordingly claim that the yong enjoy life more their older peers . Here we part company . They igonre the important facts that the the appearance of Internet is only the result of modern technologies . As a result , young people have to handle all the brand-new challenges that the older people are never facing . We can not lost sight of the obvious deficts that those people hold their conclusion .

"(ARA) Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . I agree with this statement because evereyone now only care of hisself and do not think of others , others is represent their communities . Everyone have a community to live in , but do not give it enough time to helping . What is your community ? Your community is representing you . If you do not give you community a time to help you are even do not help yourself . You must think of the time that you give your community because if you help your community , you community will develope so you will develope and you will think better to have a very good and connected community . Why young people do not give their community enought time to helping . I think that they do not think of this or this thing even do not come to their mind . For example my cousion he work very hand to get a very high salary and to have a very comfortable life and to get his family happy of what he done but he did not think that he can get his community time to help . maybe if he think they will help and this is why do not young people give their communities time they want someone to tell them because they only think of what they have and what they will have and ignore their communities . Communities is the more important thing or the first thing in young people life than other thing because you are growing and stating your life with helping from you community and you must try to give a time to helping your communities . In my conclusion , i thing that we must remind a young people and try to help them and give them solutions that will help them inorder to help them to help their community .",ARA," Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

"(ITA) As a I learned during my sociology class , a successful person is someone , who has achieved important goals that have led him to important positions of success . Of course developing new projects and obtaining positive results bring risks and doubts , but the only way to improve and cross personal limits , is to take these risks and solve them . Someone , who prefers to do only what he is sure to be able to do well , is a person who will never become successful . Nowadays , the working situation shows how always more companies are looking for employees , who have the following competencies > initiative , goal orientation , flexibility , self growth , and so on . A candidate in a job selection must prove , that he is a person with initiative in developing new strategies , and improving the company-s performance . A society will appreciate more a person , who demonstrate passion and interests in taking new challenges and facing risks , rather than someone , who does not want to improve . No company will give a promotion to an employee , who does the same work since years , just because he is sure of doing it well . A boss will give a prize to that person , who is able to develop new plans and positive approaches for the company .

"(GER) Some successful people try to do new things and take risks whereas others do n't . I can really understand these people who take risks , because everyone wants to make a bigger profit even if he or she already has a great income and additionally , life would be too boring if taking no risks and not making any changes . If I was the successful owner of , for example , a big medical company and I 've already had a lot of success and have made a good profit , why should I stop taking risks to earn much more money ? In my opinion , it would be the best to get my medical company to be the best medical company in the world . I and all of my employees would profit from that . We could , for instance , event a new medicine and would try to sell this product . And if it works well everything would be fine and if not nothing bad would happen , because I 'm already successful and I 've already earned enough money for me and my family . Hence taking risks is not very hazardous for a successful person . In addition , if this successful person would n't take any risks anymore his life would be completely boring . I believe that everyone must love his or her job and should enjoy his or her job . But there would n't be any fun when taking no risks and the job of a successful person would be rather boring . Considering me as the owner of a company , I could try to work on other fields or abroad , maybe even in another department . Indeed , these changes are riskful , but thus my job would n't be boring anyway and it 's probable that I would enjoy my job . Another important aspect is that sometimes you need to take risks and make changes not only for your own advantage , but also for the advantage of others . I could , for instance , try to spend a lot of money of my imaginary company for medical research . Actually , it 's possible that I would spend that money of my company for nothing . But nevertheless , I have done the best , because I 've tried to help others who are ill and maybe also poor . I can afford spending all of that money , because I as the owner of the company would be rich and would n't suffer hard when wasting some money when trying to help others .

Actually the bus system it 's not really developed and it cant be efficiently developed because there are too many cars around the cities , and anyway everybody prefer to use their own cars than going with buses . On the other side we know that cars make the economy run , actually to move cars need gasoline , and gasoline derivate from petroleum , thus there is a long wire that connects societies that live on cars .

"(HIN) Knowledge is the key to success , is a saying which goes a long way . Without knowledge we as humans are incomplete and not worth much . Its knowledge which seperates a fool from a learned . The most important form of knowledge in today 's world is academic knowledge . Academis knowledge is what one needs today to make a stand in society .

Academic knowledge helps us choose the career we wish to pursue in life . If we are versed with various types of subjects our choices are vast .

Therby if we just specialise in a single academic subject we are limiting our own selves restricting our very own choices . We also have the advantage that at any stage when we feel that a particular subject that we studied cannot be continued as a profession we can always fall back upon the other subjects we had studied and then adapt ourselves to our new career accordingly .

But I can not see them recently , becanse the pollutions are to heavy to cover the sky . The smokes that seeked by the cars are making a lot of pullutions in the air . And it 's seemed so harmful to our heathy . Third , the price of the oil incressed a lot , that made many people did n't want to buy a car . I alwanys saw so many cars only parked in the parking space that are did n't drive in . And when I asked a owner why he did n't drive his car , he told me that , that the money he must spent on oil when he drive his car for 2 years can buy another car . That seems like we must spend as much or more mony we buy the car to buy the oil . Taken the above reasons into account , I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today .

I ca n't imagine that there have enough space and streets can be used for more cars . First because the traffic jam are more and more common in nowadays . So many cars in our country can not be used efficently because there are lots of traffic jams in every street at early moning 7:00-9:00 , and afternoot 5:30-7:00 .

"(HIN) The young people of today are very commonly reffered to as the leaders and the great minds of tomorrow , yet we find ourselves asking wether the youth helps its community . My responce to this would be that the young people are just as concious as the elders and they fell just as responsible for the welfare of the community . To ensure that the young adults feel responsible towards their communities , they are inculcated with these values as children by making the children feel more responsible towards their srounding world . This is done by incorporating a community service section into their school curriculims and allowing the children to discover the satisfaction of sharing . These young influences are carried along with the youth and as they grow , so does their sense of responsibility to society . Then these young people do infact spend time from their busy schedules to serve the community . Nowadays we continually see student-run organizations and events that are held for the benifit of the community and also function as awareness programs to show the adults of the community what the problems within their own sorroundings are .

"(TEL) The topic at hand states that successful people do not sit back doing the same thins they have achieved , but move ahead by doings newer things . this topic is very important because it tells the what real successful man is . I agree that sucessful people try new things . The first reason is that a successful man knows the essence of success . he knows how much hard work is required to be a fruitful person . so this aspect of effort motivates him to steer ahead for reaching new heights . for example if we consider the success achieved by a gold medalist in the olympics , he will not sit back , but he will always try to perform with much hardwork the year that follows . Additionalll , the success that the person has ahcieved gives him immense amount of self confidence which is pretty essential for doing any sort of work . the confidence so established will help him to experiment new things and help him to plunge ahead . consider the same example as a gold medal winner in olympics . the gold medal he achived would give him confidence to try for breaking a world record , one that is established by others or improving on the one that he himself eatablished . so a successful man experiments and waits for the output . Finally , a successful man will have enough amount of patience to take new risks . an unsuccessful man may not have that same passion and patience as that of a successful man. now again consider the olympic gold medalist . if he misses an opportunity of breaking a new world record , he will be surely waiting with ardor for another opportunity . the moment he arrives on that he will try not to miss on that this time . consequentially a successful man will always try newer things and dares to achieve a new success",TEL," The topic at hand states that successful people do not sit back doing the same thins they have achieved , but move ahead by doings newer things . this topic is very important because it tells the what real successful man is .

"(TEL) I agree with the the statement , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities and are too busy spending time on other things . The young people of today claim to be very busy and not to have time for idle pastimes . How much of this is really true ?

With increased compititition , the student has to put in greater amount of work just to get noticed .

This is simple Demand - Supply principle of Economics . 2. Also population of world is continuously increasing . The more number of users will be there and they will use more cars . This will imply the usage of more cars than today 's era . 3. Cars are means of transport . In twenty years business will grow rapidy in differnet areas . More packages will have to be delivered or transferred . So this will recquire larger number of transpotaion hence increase in number of cars . 4.

For example , it says `` this one is powerful more than otherone . '' So everyone could think it is true . But you really do n't know before you diretly check by yourself . Every advertisement company want us to buy their things against other company which is make similar kinds . So sometimes , they just make advertisement like untruely . But if they cut from crowd , they get huge damage from that . So they trying to make best one which is cheaper and better than other company . It 's a challenge . The challenge is good for make things . If you are the only one person who can make computer , you will get a lot money from peoples . Everyone 's buy it . But you are not gonna make better one . Cause you do n't have to try to make it . Because , you can only make computer which means there is no challenge . Anyway . the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . But they have to make good things andthen try to make advertisement for show to peoples .",KOR+CHI+JPN
"(GER) I partly disagree with the statement because there are several facts every student should know or learn . For example , in history classes , it is impossible to teach history comletely without learning facts that happened in the past . How should students know important dates if their teachers leave out the information ? Certainly you can combine the two methods in your classes but they should be both handled with the same importance . Moreover , facts are something the students learn in order to understand the ideas and concept behind them . To set up another example , think of the mathematician fact that one and one is two or maybe even of the theory of relativity of Albert Einstein . What concept can you learn compared to any of these facts , or what is the idea worth without the theory behind it . What I want to say is , that one is not able to live without the other in many cases . On the other hand in addition to that , it is often said that within new methods of teaching , it would be really more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts because if you once understand something you will be able to keep it longer than if you learn it by heart . That is why a lot of teachers try to help understanding some kind of process by figures or images of themselves . To draw a conclusion , in my opinion , you can not say that one thing is more importortant than the other . Learning facts by heart is of course less important nowadays than it was in the past because new strategies have been invented . I actually think that these fit together really well , because you obviously get the best result if you first learn the fact and afterwards you may try to understand the ideas and concepts behind it .",GER," I partly disagree with the statement because there are several facts every student should know or learn .

"(GER) As far as I can see , this statement is absoluty correct . Learning or even memorizing facts might be usefull and effective right in front of an examination if you just want to pass it . But if you want to obtain good results , memorizing will not help you win the day at all . Let me clarify this . As soon as it comes to similar topics which are only associated with the content that you are familiar with , the one who only learned facts will not be able to answer the questions as appropriately as if he had learned the concept and ideas behind the facts . But as far as you are familiar with the main ideas , you will definetely be able to give brilliant answers as you only need to transfer them onto the new topic . Let me point this out on an example . I work as an assistent at the faculty of law at my university . My job is to correct term papers on several subjects associated with labour law . Within these papers students have to proof that they on the one hand have understood what was lectured during the semester and on the other hand that they are able to transport this knowledge onto new subjects . In general , I call a student `` smart and clever '' when he is capable of transporting knowledge to different subjects and develop his own position . Unfortunately I came recently to know that obviously piles of students have not really understood what the professer tried to convey . Reproduction of facts is quite boring to a teacher after having read them several times . But transportation of knowledge and using this knowledge to evaluate new problems is exciting .

Nowadays young people are much more selfish and dedcate less time to help others unless they are forced to do so .

They help for an example in sportclubs , take care of older people or are in a political party . All these activities support the community . On the other hand many young people do n't care about the community . They are a kind of egoistic and the reasons vary . Often you hear from young people that they do n't have enough time to help their community , because they have a lot of work to do . But I think this is not the entire truth . Some people are afraid of taking responsibilty for something or ca n't act in teams . Moreover they are thinking only of time or money and forget that it can be a great feeling to help others . Mostly these people are great critics but they do n't try to improve things by helping . My guess is they are lazy too . Advantages of helping in your community are that you meet interesting people and learn some skills , like speaking in front of a group or teamwork , that no teacher can teach you .

There are three reasons why I arrived at this conclusion . Firstly , in these days every one is striving for a good career - to get a good job in some reputed company or to start his own business . In this race for a good career , most of us will not care for what is going on with the outside world . Instead we will concentrate only on our aim until we get it in our hand . We will motivate all our thoughts in that direction . We will spend each and every second in our life for that goal . So we are not getting time to help our communities . Another reason is that , now a days a person becomes famous mostly because of his wealth . He will be given respect based upon his fortune . In this scenario , it 's no surprise that every one becomes greedy for wealth and fame . So we does n't waste our time for non-profit activities i.e , activities which will give no profit in form of money like helping our communities . We will focus all our time on doing some work to earn some thing . One more reason is that most of us enjoy playing sports . So if we find any leisure time we will cater it to playing instead of doing any other thing . What we also feel is that playing is conducive to health and also maintaining a good physique always fetches . Obviously there will be no free time to us when we are spending it in another way . Finally , youngsters now a days are giving more preference to their career , accomplishing wealth and also maintaining good health . They are missing the fundamental rule of helping others , which inturn helps us .

"(KOR) I agree with the statement ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ' There were two main reason for agreeing this statement . They were ` variation of choice ' and ` passionate ' . For the first reason , young people can have more choice than older people do . Usually older people have less opportunity than young people have because of their age and also they have bad health than young do . Also when older get hurt , they are recovered slower than young do because of older 's cells are too old reproduce themselves . This cause older 's choices became limited . For example , oldies cannot ride a ski or snow board as youth people do dangerous trick because they have more risk than young riders have . For the second reason is related with passionate . Young people usually have more passion than old people do . For the reason of this , it is because of hormones and the different amount of experience . Old people have less hormones than young guys have and hormones is one of scientific catalyst that made exciting to the brain . For the result of this , even if young and old people do sex with a same situation , their excitement are different because of amount of hormones . For passionate , amount of experience also affect a lot . Usually beginner has more exciting than veteran does . For example of this , when two different type of people have same girl friend , the amount of excitings are different between ladies guy and the person who never had girl friend because ladies guy already has experience about having girl friend . This relationship does not change a lot between old people and young people because old people usually have more experience than youth people have .

I do not claim that young people do not enjoy their life , instead older people do too . Those who support this statement would say that when people get old , their enthusiasm dies and due to old age health problems set in . But I would say that once we are old and free from the daily work schedule we actually get time for ourselves , your families , and our friends . It gives us the time to pursue our hobbies or passions which we could not attend to when we are busy earning money . We enjoy our grandchildren more than we might have enjoyed our children . We have the time to take care of our health , which we probably neglected when we were young and busy with work . We are more mature and more tolerant due to our experiences , and things do n't affect us as much as they did when we were not so understanding in our youth . We enjoy our hard earned money after working during all our youth . We have the time to go for holidays with family and see the world which we did n't see earlier due to lack of time . In youth due to lack of time we miss out on a lot of things which we can come back to later in our old age . In our youth , we are immature and things that we enjoy are more materialistic .

Since public area is too limited , public transportation such as bus and subway will replace private owned cars . With the growth of technology , buses in twenty years will be high-tech and of good quality . People will enjoy riding on bus more than we do today . Choosing public transportation is also a way to save our endangering natural energies . Most importantly , government will play a profound role in regulating the number of cars . As I stated , there is less and less space and energy in our globe ; thus , government of countries all over the world will take actions to reduce the number of cars . For example , increasing import tax can lead to a decline in car demand . Also , government would awards family for not driving car but taking buses to encourage others not to drive . Those actions may not benefit motor market , but will certainly help making a better environment . The global village is where everyone lives and has responsibility to protect .

As far as I am concerned one thing implies the other . If a student does not understand ideas or concepts , he will not be able to learn facts in a proper way . We shall see this clearly with an example . If a student has to learn for his history exam the main events of the French Revolution , he can just study the main facts ( such as king 's prison and death and Robespierre 's government ) but if he does only this , he will forget them easily , even before the exam .

It is true that in earlier times , when my parents studied for instance , the students were told to learn facts . Professors paid almost no attention to ideas or concepts . Nowadays , it is quite the contrary . At school , and even now , at University , we , as students , are supposed to be aware of ideas and concepts , but not of facts .

"(FRE) I actually think that it is true : a product looks usually better in the advertisement than in real . But I also think that it is normal and I 'm going to explain why . First , advertising exists for two reasons : it informs you of every new product that comes out on the market and it encourages people to buy it . When you look at an advertisement in the street or on TV , the advertiser wants you to need this object and to think about buying it , to desire it . Obviously , you will see the product ( materiel or not ) in its best aspect , sometimes presented with others products that improve the image of the product . That is the case for all the food product : for example , meat will often be presented with some beautifull vegetables or a charming sauce . And you will never see a parfume presented by a normal man or woman but by one or several top models . In this situation , it is not the product itself that is more beautifull but the context and you have the impression that the product is better than in your hands . Besides , advertising is a kind of art , and sometimes helps research for the cinema . You can test new techniques , try to film some places ( the film `` The Lord of the Rings '' was filmed in New Zealand after the landscape was tested or remarked in an advertisement ) . That explains also why such money is put in advertisment and why they are often so developped and beautifull . But the product seems better to a certain extent and they can not be physical differences between the product on TV and in the supermarket : the consumer is protected by a law that forbids to make false advertisement . So I will conclude saying that advertising enhance the image of the products and it is better like that . It only concerns us to be aware of that and not to be foul .",FRE," I actually think that it is true : a product looks usually better in the advertisement than in real .

"(HIN) I totally agree with the given statement . Ideas and concepts are associated with the thinkers and innovators . Whereas learning facts is associated with the followers . The understanding of an idea or concept gives students the ability to innovate , and to develop their ability to deal with different circumstances and problems . Merely memorizing facts will simply let the student know of a particular solution , but would not empower him/her to develop new solutions . Let us take the example of classical physics . There are several equations and several forms of equations . However , these numerous equations are derived from certain core concepts of principles . Once these principles are understood , any equation can be derived . But the understanding of these concepts is extremely important to master trhe subject . This does not only hold true in the case of science / technology areas . Understanding the concepts is critical to all areas of studies . For example , a management student refers to several case studies .

Ideas and concepts are associated with the thinkers and innovators . Whereas learning facts is associated with the followers . The understanding of an idea or concept gives students the ability to innovate , and to develop their ability to deal with different circumstances and problems . Merely memorizing facts will simply let the student know of a particular solution , but would not empower him/her to develop new solutions . Let us take the example of classical physics . There are several equations and several forms of equations . However , these numerous equations are derived from certain core concepts of principles . Once these principles are understood , any equation can be derived . But the understanding of these concepts is extremely important to master trhe subject . This does not only hold true in the case of science / technology areas . Understanding the concepts is critical to all areas of studies . For example , a management student refers to several case studies .

"(CHI) Twenty years is not a really long time for changing things in the history . I think that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today . Cars changed peoples life , i can not imagine how ours life will be without having cars , cars help a lot for the human . The reason why i think cars will not be fewers is that people needs it . We need cars to get to work , school , and other places . Well , some people will think about other transportations . That is ture , for a short distance we can walk or ride a bike , and for long distance we have airplanes and trains . However i think car is much faster than walking or riding a bike , and also cars are really flexable , we can go anywhere any time without a airplane or train ticket . we will have so much trouble without cars , they made our life easier .

In BeiJing every day there will be thousands of new cars going to the street . This also happening to any other big cities in China .

"(GER) I do not agree with the statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are . First of all the advertisors and the companies have the main goal to gain new and a high amount of costumers by advertising for their product . So the main reason why products are advertised is to show the potential costumers or consumers that this specific product might give them a nicer time or a better or even an easier life . Off course the advertised product needs to be presented from its best side so that the consumer feels attracted to buy the product and to test it first . If the costumer is satisfied with the product the product was worth it beeing advertised . But if the customer is not satisfied with the product he or she has still the right to return the product and get the money back . In general nowadays the costumers have a lot of rights to defend them selves from cheaters and companies selling products with bad qualities . To increase the competions in the capitalist market all companies try to produce products with better qualities and more attracting to the consumers . The second important reason why it should n't be in the will of the advertisors to present the product better than it is in reality is that their company and its existence depends on the a positive `` oral propaganda '' among the people . For example if one costumer is not satisfied with a product he or she will tell her friend , neighbour , relative or family not to buy it and so the company will loose costumers and off course money . The third point is that because all these given reasons a company would n't sell and represent a product if it is not hundred procent sure of the quality of the product .",GER," I do not agree with the statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .

"(CHI) In my opinion , travelling is a process for people to broaden their views fo world , to learn and share with others ' culture and to adjust their mind and body into a harmonic way .

"(ITA) The knowledge is something extremely important in our job , mostly in mine . I 'm a marine biologist and of course in all the scientific matters is useful to have knowledge on different fields . So at first glance i would respond saying that it 's better to gather informations and knowledges as much as we can in a widespreadly manner . But we have to do it in the right way , due to the fact that too much time spent on gathering informations could be time wasted . To give a good example that can back me up i want to talk about my personal experience . I 'm actually working on sounds produced by dolphins . This particular field research is not completely based on exclusively biological knowledges . In fact i firstly had to understand some physical laws about sound waves and how they propagate in the water . Once i have been trained about these informations i started to work on signals . Ashes to ashes i have been remained focused on the bioacustic of dolphins , so it could seem that i have been stuck on a specific subject . But it 's not like that . Indeed most of the time the acoustical behaviour of an animal cannot been explained just with the simply studying of bioacustic and physics , but it have to be put together with ethological studyes that most of the time are based on several different fields of knowledge . Thus i really think that it 's better to open our mind and study at 360 degree . But as i already mentioned we have to stay focused on what we are really searching for . The field of human knowledge is huge and sometimes even a good researcher can get lost in its vastity . This is the reason why most of the time i have to work with engineers and technicians that have the skill to use computer programs that can easily help us to analyze the signals that we recorded from dolphins . In a kind of way we both are important for each other , because , even if we seem to be specialized in doing something in particular , we help each other and we try to understand what is the job of the other . I think this is the best methode to share and gain knowledge of different subject . After all these years of working in this team i have gained knowledge on softwares and technical tools , and hydrophones . But i think that i could n't take all these informations just working on my own , or at least it would required me a lot of time . So for these reasons i really believe that it 's important to have a broad knowledge on different subjects , instead of being focused on just one , because sometime the answer that we are searching for , we can easily find it in a field that can seems not related to our purpose . To give another example , once the engineer i 'm working with founded a vocalization very strange . The signal was totally different from others and he did n't know how to expalin . Then he came to me and for me it was easy to explain . The signal was emitted by a calf and certainly it was different from the other member of the herd .

"(KOR) I do not agree with the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Firstly , techonology will not advance that faster that the role of cars will be replaced by the more advanced technology such as plane or ultra fast train .

To begin with , it seems impossible that the more advanced trasportation technologies such as plane or ultra fast train replace the role that current car has . It is true that in twenty years time , the techonology will be much more develpoed . However , it draws some skepticism that twenty years later , everyone has access of plane at their home like almost everyone has a car in their house today . For example , South Korea , in 1986 , already considerable number of people owned cars . In 2006 , there are still numerous number of people who are not able to get a car because they are too expensive to afford . It was impossible to even manage car for everyone in twenty years time for the country , then how would it be possible to people to manage some other advanced technology in twenty years time ?

"(FRE) I agree that most advertisement make products seem much better than they are . But I am not upset by this since the first goal of an advertisement is to make people like and buy the products . In my opinion , the real problem is that alot of people believe that some of these advertisements tell the truth and that is why we should provide some clear and objective information about the products in other to keep the consumers informed . It would be really hypocritical to say that advertisement does not li . Since its goal is to make the consumer purchase a product then it is logical to only tell the advantages of the products and not their drawbacks . For example imagine an advertisement that shows a car . If it says ` This car generates a lot pollution and uses a lot of oil ' , nobody will buy the car . But if it says ` This car if one of the fastest one and is extremely confortable ' , then a lot of men who likes speed will buy it . That why it may be logical to make a product look as good as you can if you want to sell it . Nevertheless the problem is that consummers have to be aware that advertisements do not always tell the truth . The key point is that they do n't provide a part of the information . That is why I think that it should exist some independent companies which goal is to compare the products and provide some objective information about them . For example we could imagine a study that compares all cars with the same criteria and would say about the car of my first paragraph : ` Ok , this car goes fast and is very confortable but it is not ecolocical at all and you will moreover need a lot of gas which is expensive ! ' . Thus , the men who like speed but are concerned with ecology would maybe buy an other one . As a conclusion , I think that advertisement will always make products seem much better than they really are .

As when we think of the inventions made by many inventors gives us an idea to find the new invention . '' Ideas mainly supports the invention of the new concept '' . New ideas brings the new concepts in to the field and lots of developments are mainly done by this kind of ideas . By referring different kinds of books and news papers and puzzles we can easily develope the ideas , idea is nothing but creativity , thus the creativity comprises of many ideas , as by having greater knowlwdge on any aspect then a different ideas can take place . And again we shall discuss about the concept study it will be very help full for a student because concepts make him work easily and with effectively , as it can be considered as the root for a tree , as root mainly supples food for tree , as in the same way concept helps to develope the extra infermation and for the further developement of the future analysis . These specific reasons and examples are given to support the statement that is about important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .",HIN+TEL

Fisrt of all , cars are most useful tool for people to move .

I wanted to visit many place with beautiful forest and precious plants , because my major was biology and I was very interested in the diversity of plants in Hokkado , most cold realm in our countory . A problem was that there were no means to reach the forest because few people wanted to visit there . Then I determined to use a car and I enjoyed my trip with various types of plants . If I could not use cars , I would not have visited the exciting forest . As this example shows , cars satisfy our individual requirment , suggesting use of cars will be inevitable in near future . Second , there are possiblity that scientists create new types of cars moving without petroleum . One of major problems about cars is that they use petroleum . Using petroleum causes natural environment to be polluted . Also , shortage of petroleum in the earth is annoying problem . To address these issue , for example , scientist now develop cars whose fuel is ethanol , a kind of alcohol . We can easily create ethanol from crop , especially cone because of a large amount of cone 's supply . Scientists are also developing cars moving with electricity from solar energy . This is completely clean and not harmful . Although there is many problems to realize these next generations of cars , many countries promote these study and the application will be realized soon .

Following this view , we have to know the importance of the history studies : only throught the knowledge of our past we can completely understand ideas and concepts that grew up in those periods .

Youngs should have two opinions , be happy or be anxious . In one hand , when we are young , we have lot of tree time and no responsabilities . We have time to makes interessants thinks . It is pleasant but not very exciting . In an over hand we have no job , no money and no hands on experience ; so we have reason to be anxious . My opinion is that old peoples had better reasons to be happy , than youngs ones . A lot of old peoples have do importants thinks , be may have work and help the society ; maybe they had created company and producted interessants things . Last , but not least , they have free time and wisdom . so they can do interessants thinks , playing cheese , be artist or give time in charity society . To conclude , I think that lot of old people had very good reasons to enjoy live . In fact they may have do very interessants and importants things ; so they have reasons to be proud . Wherehas youngs have no reason to be proud , But they could be excited by future .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(CHI) Mobile industry has developed for decades and people surely derive lots of benefits from driving cars . In a short time , like five to ten years , people like the ones who enjoy the feeling of driving are still in need of cars that have high quality . However , in a generally longer period , like twenty years , I agree with the speaker 's assertion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . To begin with , now nearlly every country and every city lays special focus on developing and improving its 's public transportation like the building of bus and metroway network . In twenty years time , I am fully convinced that the public transportation will be very well developed and by then people will find taking the public transportion is faster and cheaper than driving their own cars . Secondly , as people becoming more concerned with their health , they may choose to walk or riding a bicycle to work or to other place if it 's not very far from their homes . This also serves to reduce the number of people that buy and drive cars . Thirdly , thanks to the media and education , people are now becoming well aware of the deteriorating effects cars could cause to the environment . Governments are taking out procedures and making regulations to restrict the number of cars . For instance , government would place very heavy tax on the cars that people buy and restrict the times that cars could be used in the city . In sum , the car industry will be survive and the quality of cars they produce will keep on improving in twenty years . However , the quantity of cars is inevitably going to reduce due to the development of public transportion and people 's concern of health and the regulations that the government taking out to protect our environment .

"(GER) I would like to answer this question by introducing what that means : enjoy life . If people enjoy their lifes or not depends on many things . Firstly , it could depend on your hobbies , like playing basketball or fishing . Both are completely different and you might say that fishing more fits to older people whereas basketball more fits to younger people . Secondly , it depends on your social circumstances . This means some people enjoy spending time with there family . Others like to go to parties whenever possible . This also can be related to the age . Additionally it could depend on the education . Higher educated people maybe would like to visit an opera rather than hanging around in a bar . Today a lot of people think education was much better in former times . Nevertheless I believe younger people enjoy life more for several reasons ( but this answer is somehow biased , because I think I am young ) . All the reasons mentioned above cannot lead to an adequate answer from my point of view , because that are personal things . Younger people enjoy life more , because they have less responsibilities . So younger people have more space to be spontanous than older people have . Furthermore younger people are in average healthier , what gives them the possibility of doing more things in shorter period of time . In addition there is a lot of stuff to discover , what older people may have discovered already . The advantage of older people is that they have usally more money for enjoing life , but I believe that caused by todays globalization it becomes less important . Everything becomes cheaper and money is not required for enjoying life . To conclude this essay I would say that younger people can enjoy life more because of the reasons mentioned above .

"(FRE) I cannot agree with this statement for the following reasons . First , the needs for community action should be assessed taking into account the evolution of society in general . For instance , a few decades ago , providing ressources to older people was a major part of community action . Nowadays , older people have less need for this kind of material support ( development of pension plans in the ` 50s and 60 ' ) . They tend to be more independent then in the past . Older people are more in need of social contacts and activities . I believe young people do their best to respond to these needs . Second , the concept of community investment has changed . In the past , community action was viewed as some kind of obligation . People were helping the community only , or mainly , because of the moral pressure to do so . Nowadays , of course the moral aspect of community action still exist , but it is not the main motive for people to get involved into such action . Community investment has developped as an activity of its own , more like a social activity or a hobby . A good example of the way young people approach community action nowadays would be the projects developped on the campus of the university of Louvain , where I studied : student would group themselves around a particular community action and live together in a flat . The help provided by these organizations typically include help to people with disabilities , Amnesty International support , providing free basic legal advices etc . Students involved in these projects basically spend most of the academic year to make sure the projects is efficient and achieves its goals . But they never see it as some burden .

Therefore , I agree that it is more important that they understand the ideas and concepts than learn facts . First , if students learn the idea and concepts from their experiences , they will be able to easily adjust themselves to the similar problems in the future .

Second , if students learn the idea and concepts , they can modify problems and even produce the new discovery .

"(HIN) The issue of `` Understanding ideas and concepts , than to learn facts '' , is quite an interesting , raising significant interest in today 's world of competition and survival of the fittest . Many students believe that facts are more important than understanding ideas and concepts , and at first glance it appears to provide an adequate solution . However , when juxtaposed with the alternative of understanding ideas and concepts , the solution of learning facts appears less convincing . The importance to understand ideas and concepts has several advantages over learning facts as mentioned below . Firstly , by understanding ideas and concepts , students can apply the knowledge they gain while studying , to the careers they pursue later on in their life . For example a car mechanic , who understands how the machinery in a car functions , can easily diagnose the problem a car is facing , when the car is brought to the workshop . This can make him a better car mechanic , with experience he can go on to become a successful manager in an automotive shop , and someday own his own automotive company . Secondly , a better understanding of different subjects taught in schools and colleges , can have many different benefits . Let us take the example of a biology student . What he learns during his biology class can be applied to real world situations . He learns that growing trees can cause so many health benefits by improving the functioning of our ecosystem . Planting trees in an area can increase the amount of rainfall , thus solving a water shortage problem . There are many good reasons for the opposing argument to argue that to learn facts is sufficient . However it does not have the several advantages which understanding ideas and concepts has , as mentioned above . Such as better career growth and benefits to the society and environment . Thus I would like to conclude that understanding ideas and concepts provides a much better solution as it is not undermined by potential drawbacks .",HIN," The issue of `` Understanding ideas and concepts , than to learn facts '' , is quite an interesting , raising significant interest in today 's world of competition and survival of the fittest .

What he learns during his biology class can be applied to real world situations . He learns that growing trees can cause so many health benefits by improving the functioning of our ecosystem . Planting trees in an area can increase the amount of rainfall , thus solving a water shortage problem . There are many good reasons for the opposing argument to argue that to learn facts is sufficient . However it does not have the several advantages which understanding ideas and concepts has , as mentioned above . Such as better career growth and benefits to the society and environment . Thus I would like to conclude that understanding ideas and concepts provides a much better solution as it is not undermined by potential drawbacks .",HIN+TEL

First , young people need to communicate with someone who join communties because they can learn many things to become adults . Second , young people can get good experience and advise to grow their charactertistic . For example , they talk with elder people , then they have different thinking , so young people can get different view of thinking .

When you are going to start a new proyect , when you are going to start running your own buisness or if you are going to take a posdoctoral education for example you are usually entering into an unknown field , in a place wihich you are not familiarized with and where you are going to make probably many mistakes and failing exams .

By the contrary , of course you can just do what you already know and do n't want to go further in your knowledgent or education .

"(HIN) The statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts might have varied opinion depending on how a person takes it but I myself agree to the statement . For me if a student understands the idea and the concept about a particular topic , the student can get a clear picture of as to how that particular concept came into being by knowing the basics for it without ever getting the thought that how did he for that matter reach to this conclusion . Whereas had the student just learned the facts , he would be just having sort of an overview of the topic without knowing any in-depth details about that particular concept and still might have so many questions regarding the topic which he might have not been able to answer by learning the facts . Another point to understanding ideas and concepts is that upon understanding them , it would stay in students head longer and may be permanently as by understanding he would be knowing as to how a particular concept or idea evolved . He would be knowing the fundamentals for the idea or concept and once a student is clear with his fundamentals I personally think there should not be any problem anytime recalling it . This is not the case with leaerning just the facts , as one would have to keep going back to his notes or books to memorize them as the fundamentals have not been instilled into his mind which would have been the case if he might have understood it . Besides the student can also try and relate to that particular idea , which they can later narrate with ease whenever asked to do so , if he understands that particular idea , without much of straining or stressing . While this might not be the case if the student is acquainted with just the facts , as learning the facts without knowing the basics for them is equivalent to or rather is cramming which does n't help much and rather might end up pretty confused instead . An example supporting the above points that I made would be of a biology student . Had the student just learned the fact about a ecology flowchart for a particular group of animals it would be okay , but might face problems when a question comprising another group of animals is given to him as he has n't understood the basic principles onto which relationship between various animals is based .

"(CHI) There is a controversial issue about whether students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject . Depending on their distinct backgrounds and experiences , different students hold different opinions . In my point of view , I think a specific learning is better because it is more dominated in a person 's career . The most impornt reason of choosing a specialized knowledge is that nowadays the knowledge in every subject is becoming more and more difficult . On one side , as the sciense and technology develops , the knowledge of one specific subject becomes more complicated . On the other side , a person 's energy is limits by the nature . Thus , if a person insists on learn a broad range of subjuects , he will find that he is left behind the other persons more and more . For example , one of my classmates , who liked to learn lots of different subjects , such as mathematics , biology and arts , got a bad GPA during his college career . Therefore , we should not expect us to be a perfect person who knows everything . A good example , Bill Gates , the richest man in the world , may lose the match to a pupil in playing ping-pong . So becoming a person who is expert in one area is more reasonable . Another important reason is that the current society need more and more specific-trained persons , such as IT enigeers , doctors , professional player and so on . Today works can no more be classified to several types , they are elaborated to very specific jobs . For example , the computer companies have been divided to sofeware companies such as Microsoft , hardware companies such as Intel . Moreover , new types of companies are also appearing , such as internet companies , Goole . These different jobs need more and more knowledge in specified area and a narrower knowledge range compared to the past . Thus a specific-trained person is obviously more suitable than a widely-trained person . To be fair , I must own up to the importance of the elementary knowledge in a wide range . Everyone should learn broad knowledge of many academic subjects in his/her junior and senior school to detemine what he/she is suitable for . However , this broading learning is just preparing for the later deeper specialized learning which is longer and more important in one 's career .

So the olders want the people they love to enjoy their lives , not themselves , which is completely different from us . Last , there are some kind of joy that the elder ca n't enjoy , such as some physical sports , such as football , basketball and some dangerous stuff . So , in my point of view , the youth enjoy lives more than their elders do .",KOR+CHI+JPN

For example , a young boy enjoy every single moment when is riding a bycicle , no matter if this new experiment implies pain or time to get it done well , while an old man could not find it enjoyable trying to do for the first time or once again , because this person knows at some point that any mistake could cause him/her seriuos pain or physical problems that the young boy is not aware of .

"(TUR) Nowadays , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is extremely crucial but in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject of interest . According to my past experiences and studies , I came to the conclusion that people who specialize in a specific subject are usually the ones who succeed in life . For instance , my cousin wanted to be an economist and before she decided which area she wanted to specialize on , her family members gathered and discussed what must be done eventhough my cousin specifically said that she really wanted to specialize in a certain field of economics . As the time passed her parents had no chose but to agree with their daughter . Her decision of specializing on that certain area led her to get the most respected job in one of the prosperous companies in town .

"(TEL) I completely agree with the statement - '' Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . The reasons for my view are lack of ethics , lack of seriousness and lack of time . My reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs . Firstly , the young people lack ethics . What i mean to say is that the youth no longer respets the concepts like helping nature , modesty and empathy . The youth has become selfish i.e. , young people always think about themselves and no longer cares for the people who are in need of help . Many friends of mine keep going for movies and parties , very frequently . Their expenditure comes to around 1000 rupees a month , only for enjoyment . What i would like to say is that these people can help the community with money or by devoting some time but they dont . The reason for this might be lack of responsibility towards community or may be they were not tought about these things . Secondly , many of the young ones are in the mind set - what does i get by helping the community ?? My neighbour who is quite young and rich ( earning a slary of 40000 Rupees per month has never donated a single penny . Rather he spends the money on pubs , buying a new car , etc . Thirdly , few youngsters think that since they had gone through a tough time in their life , they try saving everything - not spending either for the community nor for themselves . Also , few of them dont get the time of their busy shedule in order to spare some time for the community . Lastly , many of the young people dont really understand the problems of the community i.e. , they lack empathy .

However , these products could be as what they were advertised or could be totaly different . I strongly agree with the statement that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . The reason why I agree with this statement is because I dealed with many situations like that before . First , I worked for two years in an advertisement company bake home . It war really famous company and had a world wide name . One day a maneger of a small company came to see the sall man in my company , and theay had a meeting later on . In the meeting the maneger of the small company had a product with him , he showed it to the sale man and told him that this product is not working well and the number of people who are buying this product has decreased . The man that was setting next to the maneger told him that this product will not go well becaused it has a really bad qeuality of materials and the maneger replyed to him '' do n't be worry , this advertisement company will increase the sell and the consumers will not notice the bad quality . After two months from advertising for this product , it reaches a really high number of selling ; although it has a bad qeuality . Second , I was wlaking ond day in the mall and a saw an advertisement for a cellphone . It appered to me that the cellphone can work with really high qeuality in voice and signal . Therefore , I bought the cellphone , but unfortenatily after two days the cellphone did not work with men and nothing happend as i saw in the advertisment . In conclusion , an advertisement is a really great and helpful tool to sell any product . On the other hand , it could be used in a good or a bad way . However , some companies started to ubuse this helpful tool >",ARA," Nowadays peolpe are using advertisments in many and different ways .

However , these products could be as what they were advertised or could be totaly different . I strongly agree with the statement that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . The reason why I agree with this statement is because I dealed with many situations like that before . First , I worked for two years in an advertisement company bake home . It war really famous company and had a world wide name . One day a maneger of a small company came to see the sall man in my company , and theay had a meeting later on . In the meeting the maneger of the small company had a product with him , he showed it to the sale man and told him that this product is not working well and the number of people who are buying this product has decreased . The man that was setting next to the maneger told him that this product will not go well becaused it has a really bad qeuality of materials and the maneger replyed to him '' do n't be worry , this advertisement company will increase the sell and the consumers will not notice the bad quality . After two months from advertising for this product , it reaches a really high number of selling ; although it has a bad qeuality . Second , I was wlaking ond day in the mall and a saw an advertisement for a cellphone . It appered to me that the cellphone can work with really high qeuality in voice and signal . Therefore , I bought the cellphone , but unfortenatily after two days the cellphone did not work with men and nothing happend as i saw in the advertisment . In conclusion , an advertisement is a really great and helpful tool to sell any product . On the other hand , it could be used in a good or a bad way . However , some companies started to ubuse this helpful tool >",ARA+TUR

"(TUR) Nowadays it is often mentioned that we are using up our natural resources and that there will be very few resources of fuel in a few decades . As the usable amount fuel will be getting less the the cost will get higher . Even today for a few years gas and fuel prices have gone very high . As a result of these it is claimed by some of the researchers that there will be fewer cars in twenty years time . Though I do not agree with this idea , I even think that there will be more cars in twenty years . There are two reasons that i strongly claim . First reason of the fact that there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the alternative energy sources . As engineers we predict that alternative energy sources will be in use in ten years time like sun and hydrogen energy . There are really important researches on the use of these energies for cars . Even in Turkey there are more than 40 cars using sun energy built so far . Moreover cars using hydrogen energy has already been built but still being worked on . When we come over this energy problem , in other words make the last car products working with alternative energy there will certainly be an increse in the number cars in use . The second reason is that in twenty years there will still be plenty of petrol that can be used ( may be more expensive ) .

"(FRE) When you think about the advantages or disavantages of being young compare to be older , you can look around you and observe how many peoples try to stay young and in good health . Indeed , so many peoples take care of their body in order to stay young that they must be sad because they are becoming older . In this paper , we will present all the problems you avoid when you are young before listing some reasons why young people enjoy life more . First of all , a lot of mature adult stop enjoying their life because they are always thinking that it was better when they were young because they had less problems , they think that they were more beautiful and day after day the situation worsens . This kind of people waste a part of their life just because they are complaining about a time that they will never know again . Indeed , now they have more responsabilities , more pression because of their job and most ot them have a family which is a big responsability . All those reasons make them nostalgic about their former life when everything was so easy since they had just to think about themselves . The previous argument is true , young people can enjoy more their life because they have the freedom to do nearly everything , to take their own decision without involving the agreement of someone else . If you decide to leave in an other in one month , it will be so easier to do for a single or a couple compare to a family with three children . Moreover , i believe that young people are generally happier because they can still dream about a lot of thing , they can dream about a great family , a great house , a great job ... whereas mature adult have the experience and they have already noticed that sometimes , everything is not going according to plan . Finally , young people have a lot of spare time , they can do everything when they are still at university : sport , arts , shows , parties ... A lot of stuffs that people who have already a job can not carry on doing . To conclude , the main reason why young people enjoys their life more than older people is due to their personal situation . Indeed , an older people has a job , a family , less spare time ... even if you can have a lot of fun in your job and with your family , in my opinion , nothing can be as nice as the freedom you have when you are young and all the opportunities you still have to manage your life on the way you have decided .",FRE," When you think about the advantages or disavantages of being young compare to be older , you can look around you and observe how many peoples try to stay young and in good health .

"(SPA) My grandfather was 90 years old when he passed away . While his life had ended , mine still continued . However , I could in no way say that he did not enjoy life . He was one of the most charismatic people I ever knew and if someone had had any experience about life , it was him . One has to admit that younger people are able to move much faster , and learn much faster , but the truth of the matter is that older people have already learned their lessons , and thus are more able to enjoy life . Nowadays , youth has the possibility of using technology , which has made life so much more fun , and provided various ways of entertainment such as movies or the Internet . Also , the fact that we are young in the 21st century allows us to experience much more than our elders experiences during their youth . As I was telling my friend Mike the other day , there is no way enjoy life without youth . Precisely the fact that we have not learned our lessons yet , opens up the possibility of discovering new worlds and having new experiences , which our elders simply do n't have at the moment . While youth does have the added bonus of more time left , older people have the added bonus of their experience . With time , a person can learn to do new things , find new things , which will simply benefit his or her life . For example , the fact that my dad has travelled to Paris and knows all the good places there allows him to visit them again and again , something a young person with no travelling experience will not be able to do . Also , an older person is more likely not to depend on someone economically or legally , which allows them to be freer , than their counterparts : the young people . In conclusion , I would say that while older people are maybe not as capable of moving as fast as younger people , age does not prevent anyone from enjoying life to the maximum point . I will always remember my grandfather , anxious to show his experiences and colorful life to his nieces and nephews while continuing to live his live to the fullest .",SPA," My grandfather was 90 years old when he passed away .

Students should be taught how to admire these real things ( facts ) in our daily life , the ideas and concepts can not help students to learn more about the creatures . Second of all , most of the ideas and concepts are in the book , if students are just studing theses ideas and concepts , than they will lose many chances to be in touch with Nature . In contrast , Nature may help children find more ideas and concepts than in the books throughout the practice in the outside . Last but not the leat , the ideas and concepts are the results from the scientists or the phylogists , they may get these ideas and concepts in wrong ways . According to today 's registrations , many new and correct ideas and concepts are out .

"(FRE) From my point of view , I totally agree with the statement that advertisements emphasize and magnify some products in a questinnable way . For at least three caracteristics , which are quality , quantity and effectiveness , advertisements often misleading . Marketing makes us believe that the product we are buying is the best on the market and that you could not find a better product in the whole world . For example , Mac Donalds ' burgers are often cited in advertisements as the best burgers in the world . Although I agree that they are pretty good , Burger King 's burgers are also very good . Other examples could be find with toys . Children often think that that will have a toy bigger than it really is because of the way it is exposed in the advertisement . You could also manipulate people with the quantity you are selling to them . As for instance , a marketing campain could make you believe that you are purchasing 1000 kilograms of a specific ingredient , when in fact your are purchasing only 1000 pounds of it , that is a typical trap . Another manipulation from advertisements is to make a product efficient when this product is not working . There are countless version of advertisements claiming that a product is the one with which you will loose your overweight or with wich you will refind your youth . In fact it never works , but the marketing does .

"(HIN) Most product need to be advertised according to me . Advertisement helps the people to know more about the products in details . Advertisement increase the demand of the product . It also helps the seller to increase the sale of the new product .

So advertisement also equally plays an important role in comparsion to the production of goods their market strategy , testing etc . One more example : If suppose two company had launched their product at the same time and out of those two one had done a good advertisement before the product comes into the market and other had not done any advertisemnt of their product . We may find the difference in sale of the two products . The product which is advertised is saled among public because people are aware of the product . They know it will fulfill thir demands . But at the same movement the product which is not advertised their will be no sale of that product though the product is much better then the product which is advertised before their launching in the market .

"(SPA) I am totally agree . In elementary school teachers show an old way to learn about everything , specially areas of study like history , literature , geography , philosophie or civism has taken by students like a bunch of names , dates and facts that they have to memorize . Nowdays I figured out that memorize facts is not the best way to understand . In Graduate School I had the oportunitie of take a lot of understandable classes that I can still remember . The best way to learn and understand at the same time is doing more than one reading , consult more than one book or one opinion about something so you can have more than one point of view . For example , if I have to investigate about Modern Architecture may be I can talk about La Ville Savoye of Le Corbusier in Poissy , France , 1929 . But the only thing I am doing there is taking some information that already exist and writing it down in my paper . That is just a transcription . But in stead of that if I try to understand the philosophical fundaments of the Modern Movement , the reasons of Le Corbusier that made him design a diferent kind of building ( never seem untill that year ) and explain the origins and reasons of this architecture I will surely explain to everybody , including mysefl the results of my investigation making not just remember it but know the who , when , and most important of al , the why .

"(KOR) I am agree with the statement saying , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than it is today . '' The use of cars is in the increasing stage during these days . However , I believe that this condition will completely change during next twenty years . First reason of reduce in use of car will be pollution of the environment . Car is the main cause of pollution of the earth every year . This fact was most likely ignored by the people during past few years . However , people start to recognize the importance of maintaining good environment condition and try to do their best for it . Other reason that cars will be less used in the future is the globalization . Globalization means that the world is not separating as an individual but conforming as one big community .

In fact , people even start to use transportaion such as subway or airplane more than the car . The final reason that effects the use of the cars is the development of the technology .

"(GER) `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . '' I disagree to this statement because of the following reasons . First , there is a problem in defining the term `` enough time '' . It remains unclear how much time any given person should spend helping the community . Furthermore , who decides what is helpful to the community ? Which things that have to be done in a community should be done by volunteers and which should be done by professionals ? These questions arise when accusing young people of not spending enough time helping their communities . Apart from these terminological problems , there are so many young people doing voluntary work for the community . I experience that they spend their time working for the Red Cross , helping at home looking after elder family members , getting involved with the scouts or at church . These are just examples of the many places in a community where you easily find young people helping the society .

In the afternoon and at night they are busy doing their homework , having a job to earn extra money or they have hobbies ( e.g. sports or music ) . Due to globalization , competition between young people has become more . They have to work harder in order to be prepared for their future .

"(TUR) This essay will discuss the overall advantages of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject . I will begin by stating that the particular enviroment and situation a person is in does determine the outline of the necessary knowledge . Since this is the case , let us observe two different cases where things may differ to a certain extent . First , I would like to consider a student who is a freshman at a 4 year college . Until he chooses his major , he will have to start accumulating knowledge in many different subjects in order to have enough information to determine what he really wants to focus on . Once he chooses his major , he will then start specializing on one particular subject . But , at this point , it is very important to observe that he still will need to be studying other broader subjects to enhance his development as a whole . Thus , even the choice of a single focal subject is enabled by understanding a spectrum of other broader subjects . Next , let us imagine that this student has graduated and joined the work force . If we simplify things for the sake of argument , we could have two different situations on our hands . In one case , the student prefers to stay in an academic enviroment and teach . To be able to get a college teaching position , for example , he will have to specialize even further on his chosen path through higher education . But , even while focusing further , he will try to increase his knowledge of subjects related to his own particular subject since this one of the fundemental requirements of becoming a good educator . On the other hand , if he chooses to join a company , the people who hire him will probably expect him to be versatile and function in different divisions of the company . Again , as I stated before , I am oversimplifying these situations due to time and space constraint . In conclusion , even in situations requiring focus on a specific subject , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a must . This enables one to become a well rounded educated person with enough information in different subjects wh see the bigger picture whenever necessary .",TUR," This essay will discuss the overall advantages of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject .

In their school , they cannot learn enough knowledge . Moreover , many young people is always playng with their friends or is always staying at home despite of no something to should be done .

"(HIN) The issue at hand is '' Do advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are ? `` . Yes , I strongly agree with the above point . In today 's developing world media and advertisements do play in major role in enhancing the product . Firstly the general public or the customers who are buying or going to buy a particular product are attracted by the advertisement of that product rather than the quality and the performance . Advertisements are done with famous people which attracts many of their fan 's and they start using that particular product . For example if a actor is using a particular brand of perfume then his/her fans do follow him without actually considering the quality . In this way i feel most advertisements make product seem much better than what they really are . Secondly most of the advertisements contains graphics and high resolution videos and images . They are visually more appealing and attractive to look at . Due to the use of multimedia technology more and more clients get attracted and buy the product instead going for their properties and long lasting nature . For example in an advertisement its shown that a bicyle ( product ) collides with a bus and nothing happens to the bicycle which is not at all possible . So again advertisements seemed to make products much better than what they really are in real life . Thirdly advertisements lead to the increase in the sales of a particular product whether it is really good or not . Many companies use advertisements to increase their sales of product . Their main aim behind is to earn maximum profit . Furthermore many of the firms use advertisements as an intelligent weapon to show superior features in their product when compared to the product of different firm , so that the customer is tempted to buy their product .

"(FRE) First , we have to analize what is a successful person . In a general way , it is somebody who realize something which makes him richer in a psychic or material way . Do we need to act in a creative and brave manner to be successful ? Is it necessary to show all those vertues to be successful ? Is it the only condition to be successful ? In one hand , successsful people need to be recognized to be considered as successful . So , it means that recognition is mandatory to be successful . In the other hand , somebody may have a lot of vertues and those two mentioned before and however being unrecognized . It is possible for people to try new and dangerous things like basejump , but without being outstanding and recognized , this person is not yet successful , only in a private manner like in his family which I would not call successful . The second issue to look after is if it is possible to get successful without any of those vertues . First , a successful person can show only one of those vertue and be successful . Somebody creating new show but based on the same rules as another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risks . And somebody can risk his life all the time doing the same thing , as a circus member , and then becoming famous and successful . Finally without any of those vertues , somebody can heird everything from another and get indirectly successful . We have seen that success is not related to the vertues enounced in the statement . Then , I would say that anybody can be successful , however it is not linked to any will of the person but it is due to other factor dependant on environment . In spite of the possible random of the success , the person must act in a certain manner to attract the success knowing that could be in vain .",FRE," First , we have to analize what is a successful person . In a general way , it is somebody who realize something which makes him richer in a psychic or material way . Do we need to act in a creative and brave manner to be successful ? Is it necessary to show all those vertues to be successful ? Is it the only condition to be successful ? In one hand , successsful people need to be recognized to be considered as successful . So , it means that recognition is mandatory to be successful . In the other hand , somebody may have a lot of vertues and those two mentioned before and however being unrecognized . It is possible for people to try new and dangerous things like basejump , but without being outstanding and recognized , this person is not yet successful , only in a private manner like in his family which I would not call successful . The second issue to look after is if it is possible to get successful without any of those vertues . First , a successful person can show only one of those vertue and be successful . Somebody creating new show but based on the same rules as another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risks . And somebody can risk his life all the time doing the same thing , as a circus member , and then becoming famous and successful . Finally without any of those vertues , somebody can heird everything from another and get indirectly successful . We have seen that success is not related to the vertues enounced in the statement . Then , I would say that anybody can be successful , however it is not linked to any will of the person but it is due to other factor dependant on environment . In spite of the possible random of the success , the person must act in a certain manner to attract the success knowing that could be in vain .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER

"(KOR) I do not agree with the statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . Even though it will be much more convenient to depend on the tour guide and follow wherever the tour guide may lead as a group , the essence of travel which sprout from experiencing the sense of adventure , as well as the sense of being an explorer while we travel cannot be obtained if we had a tour guide and traveled as a group . Firstly , if we travel in group led by a tour guide , we may not have to research about the place we want to travel . This is known as `` package tour '' where tourists would go to the well-known tourist attractions rather than planning the trip and getting the first-hand account of exploring the unfamiliar place . This then will eliminate the core of travel . We would follow the tour guide just as a flock of sheep and we will be limited to see only what tour guide decides to take . In this sense , travelvers will not be able to travel places where they would personally like to go . This then brings up another issue of traveling as a group . If we travel as a group , we will not be able to take break or have our own time of rest . Rather , we would have to follow an austere , tight schedule that is already set . Of course , if we had the tight schedule , then we will probably be able to cover the area that we were told to visit , however , we will not be able to take more time on a particular place of our own interest . This means that another essence of travel , enjoyment while knowing about the place in a relaxed atmosphere , will be hindered if we traveld in a group led by a tour guide . Furthermore , if the group of people that we travel with have noisy children , or if per chance people do not get along , then I think this will not be a travel that we want to cherish . Therefore , I personally think group travel following a tour guide is not the best way to travel . I would rather travel with a couple of my close friends or family members where we can take time to enjoy every aspect of going on a trip starting from planning to exploring on our own to the way we like the most .",KOR," I do not agree with the statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Of course behind this process there are plenty of professionist that just work on it all the time . To make you feel , you cannot leave without that `` mobile '' phone . I am old enough to know that the life is possible ( and may be better ) without that mobile , even if it seems to me , when I think about it , that it has allways exist . Pruduct can be as good as they are advertised , the trick is , how to make peaople think that thay ca n't leave without it , and I am sure they will find a way to sell you anithing they want . There is also a copmetition between them , I mean between the sellers , so that they have to show his products compare to a `` common '' one , and tell you the reasons why his product is much better compare to another , wich is usually less costly . But this is another issue .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(ITA) I think that I am the kind of person who is willing to give a lot of time to helping my community , but when I get right down to it I can not find so much time . Probably , like me , a huge amount of persons experiences the same problem . I absolutely agree with the statement but , at the same time , I can understand why different categories of people do not spend time helping others . First of all , young people are extremely busy with their classes and sport activities . Writing papers , preparing seminars and doing homeworks require quite half of the day of each student . In addition , they are usually asked to be part of a sport team and so they spend several hours a week training and improving their performances . As a consequence , they are unable to help others , but I think that they do not feel happy about it . Normally students are altruist and they feel like they are wasting time when they can not improve the life of the community they belong to . Secondly , people , who have a family and children , are completely full of stress . Sometimes , they have their own work in the morning and then once at home they have to take care about children . I think that the real problem is that the life is too fast for them . All day long , families are planning something or improving something different . In this way , they can not understand the importance of taking their own time and dedicate some of it to the community . Poor and alone people , for instance , would be enthusiastic spending a weekend with a family , but , anyway it does not happen so frequently . Concluding , I want to say that even if I can understand different and valid reasons that lead people living apart from their communities , I hope that , tip by tip , everyone will recognize the importance of spending time within a community . It can add value to the routine everyone experiences during the week .

I hold this believe because cars have already caused too many damage to the environment and use a lot of natural resources , hence they will be eventually superseded by other highly environmental friendly transportation tools .

I think that if you got a broad knowledge , you will know what people mean when they talk aboute a topic you have heared aboute , even if you dont know much aboute it . You are not focused on your special subject tho whole time . You can free your mind , you are open for new things . Although the knowledge of only one subject , your special subject , offers good abilities for you , i prefer knowing less things aboute many subjects .

Indeed , in this particular context , taking risks can be innovating and trying to get a product well known from everyone .

Moreover , in order to reach scinetific prefction we need to be awear of the facts . the main problem with leaning facts could be foregoten if did n't use or apply it in your life in some how . Everybody understant the imprtance of learning ideas which interact whith your real life . this method to build a healthy youth who are capeble to find their way in life easily . Balancing between these methods is acually what we need . If sacrificed one of them the results would be harmful to us . so , we all should support the balancing advicats .",ARA+TUR
"(TUR) Do you think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ? Some people believe in this dream . However , I do not agree that that many people might give up on using cars in twenty years . I have got several reasons to think so . First of all , the statistics done up to now show us that there has been a rapid increase in the amount of cars in use all around the world . Moreover , it seems that it is more likely to keep increasing . There are three major explanations for this rapid increasem : `` The decrease in the cost of making cars , the population growth and the overal recovery in people 's financial situatuion around the world . '' These and related factors have been enabled more and more cars to be produced . Secondly , we can easily see that transportation heavily depends on cars in most of the countries around the world . For example , in the U.S there are states and cities , like Dallas , where there is no presence of a good public transportation . You almost have to have a car in order to go somewhere . Moreover , statistics show that more than 60 % percent of the world transportation rely on cars . Thirdly , people have been considering cars as a need rather than a luxury . Especilly men start to dream of a car starting from their childhood . Most people would not want to give up on their cars or their dreams to have a car . Maybe in the future , in metropolitan cities like New York and Istanbul , some people might stop using their cars or can be forced to do so because of the terrible trafic problem . In conlusion , it strikes me that in twenty years there will be not fewer but more cars in use than there are today because of such reasons I have mentioned above .",TUR," Do you think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?

"(FRE) Who is the smartest ? An average student who goes to school 8 hours every day , or a student who goes to school just 3 or 4 hours a day and then has to go work to complete his degree ?

First of all , we can say that everybody functiuns in a different way . Indeed , some people prefer to learn ideas instead of people who prefer to learn and understand by using facts . A very good example is the way we act with a using notice . Some of us will rather read all the manuel and then start to look at the computer for example ; however , some of us will throw the notice away and will directly look at the computers to rty understand how it works ; they will try to make it functiuns by themselves . They will maybe press a button they feel is useful and then follow their intuition to make it works . If it does n't work , those people will try something else untill the computer is on . In a second part , we can say that school should be more opened to taught students more fact than they do actually . Indeed , if some students have troubles with school , it 's maybe because the system is not well-adapted for them . Perhaps , they will fell more comfortable if the teachers were using more facts and more concret examples than whan they just teach their class with ideas and concepts which can sometimes seem unreal . For example , when a business instructor is talking about a specific startegy , it seems unbelievable that he does n't give any specific axamples to his students to make them see how this strategy can work in a real job environment .

In the light of this idea , I definitely think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Actually there are three main reasons that will cause this decrease . First of all , the oil reserves on the earth has been decreasing . The decrease in the amount effects the oil prices . Even in the last 3 years the oil prices increased dramatically .

As the price of oil increases , the number of people who can afford a car will decrease and the total number of cars will diminish . Secondly , I think that cars are not a good way of transportation and in twenty years , other means of trasportation will be invented . The cars are not feaxible to be used in both over the sea and in the air . As the requirements of the humankind increases , they will search for more flexible means of transportation . For instance , flying vehicles can be invented in twenty years and that can be very feasible to used . Therefore the car requirement will decrease and there will be less vehicles called ` cars ' .

"(ITA) I strongly agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . Actually I think that trying new things is the most important thing to do to become successful . If a person tries new experiences and discovers new things , then he or she has the possibility to learn to do those things very well and to develop them becoming successful in doing those things . As a result this person would be considered a pioneer by other people in the `` area '' she 's working at . For example , to become successful a manager could find out a new way of running his business : for istance he could try to improve the methods of working , to decrease costs or to make people work harder by using promotions . This manager would be recognized as a successful person because he has discovered a new way of working that allows the factory to save money , time and to do better . Moreover I believe that successful people are used to taking risks more than other people do because of their enthusiasm for new situations and because they have an optimist view of the situation that they have to face with . In fact being an enthusiastic and optimistic person helps to face new situations and helps working out good solutions to problems . For example , if a manager strongly believes in what he is doing , I 'm pretty sure that he will achieve his aim ; if this manager stongly believes in his decisions , he wo n't stop working when he will meet difficulties or problems , but he will work harder to find a solution and go on doing what he has planned to do .

Though no such statistical data exist as of now but being a part of the young generation of India , I myself can support my stance with several examples . The best example that can be qouted is of the recent devastation caused by T-sunami . The vast destruction caused by upsurge of tremendous tidal waves not only affected economically but also led to casualities and serious injuries . In this situation , from primary school children to college graduates united here in India to help the needy . We being the part of this association went door to door to ask for any form of help , that included money , medicines , clothes , food etc . Even the NGO 's and well acclaimed societies like Red Cross and SOS acknowledged this enthusiastic participation of youth of India and well assured that the funds and support liquidated to the proper cause . T-sunami was just an example and this happened in case of Gujrat earthquake and other disastors . Though it should not be inferred that this kind of participation is only restricted to natural calamities only . Nowerdays , students participate more in programmes like National Cadet Camps ( NCC ) which go to rural areas to help understand their problems and educate them about certain topics like AIDS . Moreover , blood donation camps is another example of frequent participation of young people to support their communities . Appart from that the technological advancement has made it feasible to provide modern and extensive techniques that ultimately leads to social and financial upliftment of communities . In developing countries like India , we are still having a large population that needs to be properly educated . Nowerdays more capable and intellect people are getting into politics and civil services . It is the young doctors who cure disease and it is the young engineers who make a village glow at night . The extensive research done now will definately have implications for the betterment of the future . If we look into the situation more practically , we will see that more and more young people are participating in the development and upliftment of their communities . Though some population is still not as enthusiastic about community service yet i would state that , `` Nothing is perfect '' . It will be illogical to expect cent percent participation .

"(ITA) For what concerns my point of view , nowadays advertisment is used to convince people buying products that are often of lower quality than they seem on the tv spots or on the advertising spaces . I think most of the companies are only interested in earning as much money as possible . Their policies don-t always care about ethic and moral principles . This attitude is reflected in the way they act when advertise their products . They want to caught the eye of the consumers with bright colors , wanderful images of idyllic places , beautiful women , music and similar things . They work hard , thinking about what attracts the majority of the people , what are the desires and the dreams that their target customer has . But on the other side they do not invest enaugh money and time to improve the quality of the goods . I think every customer at least once experienced the misleading informations advertising conveys . When I was a little child I always want my parents to buy things I saw in the television spots . For instance , when I was six I was amazed by the spot of a doll that could speak with children . I thought that she was able to answer every question I may ask to her . But when I went to the toys shop and I tryed it I was really sad in understanding her abilities were only crying and saying she was hungry , thirsty and sleepy .

I think most of the companies are only interested in earning as much money as possible . Their policies don-t always care about ethic and moral principles . This attitude is reflected in the way they act when advertise their products . They want to caught the eye of the consumers with bright colors , wanderful images of idyllic places , beautiful women , music and similar things . They work hard , thinking about what attracts the majority of the people , what are the desires and the dreams that their target customer has . But on the other side they do not invest enaugh money and time to improve the quality of the goods . I think every customer at least once experienced the misleading informations advertising conveys . When I was a little child I always want my parents to buy things I saw in the television spots . For instance , when I was six I was amazed by the spot of a doll that could speak with children . I thought that she was able to answer every question I may ask to her . But when I went to the toys shop and I tryed it I was really sad in understanding her abilities were only crying and saying she was hungry , thirsty and sleepy . Now I-m no more a child but often products that attracts me with advertising don-t satisfy me at all . I think that governments should be more severe with companies , checking if the standard of goods really meet the promises of the spots . The companies can-t be free of telling lies to the customer , beside this he must = e protected by the law .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER

"(GER) The mobility of society is a topic which is often discussed : in newspapers , in politics , but also among friends . Should there be less cars to decrease pollution ? Yes , there should , but in my opinion this will not happen in the next twenty years . On the contrary , I think that the numbers of cars in the world will stay the same or probably even increase . Different reasons such as the need for mobility , improved road conditions , a better economic situation in developing countries and the growth rate of the population will lead to a constant or even higher amount of cars . First of all , mobility is one of the most important points for modern society . Also in twenty years , this wish for mobility will still going on . People still want to be mobile , to reach everything within a shortest time period . As it is , cars are the fastest medium of transportation , at least for short distances . Thus , the majority will not be willing to give up his or her car only to decrease pollution . In Switzerland , there is a lively discussion about improving and extending roads to absorb all the traffic . Also in other countries , these measurements are of high interest . If there are more and better planned roads and therefore less traffic jams , even more people will think about buying a car and using it to reach for example their work place . Considering developing countries , they hopefully will have improved their situation in twenty years at least a little bit . Less poeple will live in poverty , and more will be part of the middle class . This positive development also leads to a higher demand of cars , because a car is a symbol for having enough money . In developing countries it is even more important for people to show how much they earn and therefore to climb the social ladder . Finally , the simple fact that the world population in the whole is growing indicates that there will be more car owners in the future than now . The growing demand for mobility in Western countries as well as the longer the more in developing countries leads to a higher number of cars in the world . This development is supported by the fact that a lot of countries are thinking of expanding their road system .

When you already know that you can do something , it 's just normal that you try a new thing . Everybody wants to try new things . Small children are the best examples .

"(GER) In my opinion , the car and other vehicles used for transportation have a central position in our modern society . The use of cars will therefore not decrease but even grow in the future . To ensure that development being sustainable we have to make great efforts in science and technology . First of all , I am convinced that transport in general is the heart of our modern world economy . The globalisation of our world has only been possible because of a broad and intensive use of cars , trucks , ships and other vehicles . Within this process the structure of our modern economies got more and more focused on cheap transport and mobility . Second , cars a an important part of the people 's daily life in every modern society . We use cars to travel , to work , to go shopping and even to compete against each other ( e.g. in motocar races ) . Beside that , it is an important status symbol for many upper and middle class people . In my opinion , the importance and therefore the demand for cars will increase substantially on a worldwide scale - especially in developing countries as China or India where the new emerging middle class is heading for private cars . But there are also problems with a possibly growing number of cars around the world : First of all , the exhaust fumes and production process will cause a lot of environmental damage . The second problem that arises is the question how all those cars and vehicles can be fueled . The worldwide quest for petroleum and oil , from which gas for cars is made of , is growing higher and higher . To challenge those two problems , scientists and car producers have to concentrate on doing research to find alternatives to the current car concepts . There are promising ideas and experiments , but still no revolutionary new concept to assure a sustainable use of transportation vehicles in the future . Finding those alternatives is absolutely necessary to further enjoy the benefits the car brings to different societies and economies around the world .",GER," In my opinion , the car and other vehicles used for transportation have a central position in our modern society .

For example if a young man wants to go for a tour in his holidays then the first thing that comes to his mind is where to go , whom to take , when etc but when a old persom considers a trip to go somewhere the first thing that comes to his mind is how long will be the journey and what all precautions he needs to take . young people can freely do whatever they want but older people may have many health problems which will restrict them from doing things which they wuold have liked to do . Young people can eat , drink do anything they like but older people will have many restrictions . When it comes to sports young people are encouraged to play many of them where as older people are always cautioned and even they are afraid play to there full potential . Older peoples mind set is mainly different when compared to younger people like they look at life as journey coming to an end mostly thinking about what they have achieved and feeling satisfied where as young people never think of ther past they always plan their future , they view there life as a beggining of a great journey . For example older people think about there college times when they were young always thinking of the funny things and there personal experiences and feeling satisfied . Where as young people think and plan about there how to enjoy there life like planning to go for tour with friends or play games with his friends , constantly thinking how to enjoy there life .

Young people do enjoy there life morethan older people , young people have more energy and more adrenalin which heips them to do whatever they want on the other side older people have less energy and enthusiasm , there bodies are weak and so they have to think twice before they do anything . For example if a young man wants to go for a tour in his holidays then the first thing that comes to his mind is where to go , whom to take , when etc but when a old persom considers a trip to go somewhere the first thing that comes to his mind is how long will be the journey and what all precautions he needs to take . young people can freely do whatever they want but older people may have many health problems which will restrict them from doing things which they wuold have liked to do . Young people can eat , drink do anything they like but older people will have many restrictions . When it comes to sports young people are encouraged to play many of them where as older people are always cautioned and even they are afraid play to there full potential . Older peoples mind set is mainly different when compared to younger people like they look at life as journey coming to an end mostly thinking about what they have achieved and feeling satisfied where as young people never think of ther past they always plan their future , they view there life as a beggining of a great journey . For example older people think about there college times when they were young always thinking of the funny things and there personal experiences and feeling satisfied . Where as young people think and plan about there how to enjoy there life like planning to go for tour with friends or play games with his friends , constantly thinking how to enjoy there life .

"(SPA) Alone , the Best Way to travel it I disagree with the statament that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . I consider that it is better to travel alone . I believe that when people travel in groups , they have to be accountable to the group . This can be very stressful and could affect the way they enjoy their vacations or trip . For instanse , if anything happen to any person of the group , the other people have to wait or spend time assisting this person . In the contrary , I believe that when we travel alone we are able to develop our own schedule and to enjoy more freely without any interferance from any other person . This will have a possitive impact in our vacation or trip that it was ultimately taken in order to relax and enjoy as much as possible . Also , we will spend the time in the best manner without wasting time . Moreover , when we travel in a group with a tour guide , we are not able to decide our trip 's plan , but we have to relay on the guide for any step to take during the trip . In the oppositive , if we travel alone we know that we can make any decision regarding our trip 's plan or to decide the lenght of our stay or visit depending on our own circunstances , which defenitevely is more suitable and appropriate for me . The goal is to enjoy the trip . Also , travelling alone seems to be less expensive that travelling with a tour guide . The fact that we have to hire a guide will increase the cost of the trip . Furthermore , I believe that if travel alone , we will have more time to see the thing that really interest us . For instance , in my own expenriece , when I visit a museum i like to spend enough time looking at the pictures rather than the other things . If i have to follow a tour guide during a trip , it could happen that he or she will show the group the things that he or she considers important for her/his own , but it could be less important for me . This could be dissapointed in the case that you cannot move forward to really enjoy or see what you really want to do . Moreover , if you want to take any break during the trip , you will allow to do so if you are alone without asking anybody for permission .

"(GER) Acutally , the people getting much older than at older times . That is a result of the development of better drugs . But in additon to getting more older the old people have a better life than the younger generation . In my opinion they can enjoy life more than young people can do , because of some basically reasons . First older people do not have to go to work . They had worked for an average of 35 years and so they are getting pension . They have more free time that mean all the time they have in leisure . They can sleep 10 hours a day . I think that can not do the younger generation . For example my grandmother sleep 11 hours a day . So she is fit and do not feel tired . Younger people are often feel tired because they can not sleep so much time because they have to go to where they work . Another reason is that older people have more money than the younger have . The older generation had saved money in the time they had worked . The young people had not saved so much money . The older generation can buy a lots of things . All time of the day they can do a shopping - tour because they have enough money . In addition to this the older people can fly everywhere they want for holiday . They are very flexible . In contrast to this I do not think that the younger generation is so flexibil in time . Another example is that older people have more social contact . They can meet each other for breakfast , for a cup of coffee or something else . Younger people have the problem of the flexibility because if they have free time their friends might not have free-time .

"(FRE) I believe that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts . Understanding ideas and concepts can lead to interesting debates , it can be used in our everyday life and it can also help us understanding different facts from the past . Facts are only dates and names in books or newspapers , while concepts and ideas let us imagine different possibilities through different aspects of life . First of all , understanding ideas and concepts can lead a classroom or a group of friends into an interesting debate . By exchanging opinions about a particular concept , for example , communism , we can learn new things and support our opinion by giving arguments . Understanding the ideas of our mates is also important . It gives us a chance to be in the other person 's position . It helps us to have a wider frame of mind . Secondly , being educated about many concepts and ideas can help us in our everyday life by helping us taking an important decision . For example , if you have to vote at a provincial election , you need to understand what thesis each candidate supports . You need to be aware of the consequence that each political party can bring to the population . You can develop your own opinion based on ideas and concepts , and then make a choice about the party that will get your vote . Lastly , the capability to understand concepts can help you understand different facts that happened in the past .

"(TUR) I disagree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of some reasons . My some of the reasons to disagree that idea are ; first of all enjoying life does not connected to age completely , secondly when years are passed people get more experinced and finally older people understand life better than younger ones which help them to enjoy more . To begin with , lets try to define ` enjoying` . Is enjoying related to your phsical situation ? what i think is that enjoying is having fun and being happy in a certain time period which is not dependent to your phsical situation but your mental property . you can be very healthy about your muscles , organs and all your body but it doesnt mean anything if your mental condition is alright . Additionally , experience is very important in life to enjoy it . A famous singer says ` i know what it is to be young but you dont know what it is to be old ' when he reached the considerably old ages . People who lived a lot of things - which can be consired as ` taste ' in life - learn how to defend and stand for bad happenings and it must help them to be happy even if they are in very bed situations . Finally , life is not very easy to understand and identify . Every second passed through our life helps us to achive the understanding of the aim and that identification of life . This identification helps people to enjoy since the unavoidable end of this life is to ` die ' . Young people live as if they will never die whereas olders see that end easier than the youth that philosophical finish . Hence , i dont believe the idea that older people enjoy life less than the younger people do because i think it doesnt completely dependent on age and the reasons i mentioned above .

People who lived a lot of things - which can be consired as ` taste ' in life - learn how to defend and stand for bad happenings and it must help them to be happy even if they are in very bed situations . Finally , life is not very easy to understand and identify . Every second passed through our life helps us to achive the understanding of the aim and that identification of life . This identification helps people to enjoy since the unavoidable end of this life is to ` die ' . Young people live as if they will never die whereas olders see that end easier than the youth that philosophical finish . Hence , i dont believe the idea that older people enjoy life less than the younger people do because i think it doesnt completely dependent on age and the reasons i mentioned above . I see a lot of young people never enjoy whereas a lot of very old people smiling and having fun with their friends .",ARA+TUR

They want you to think that if you are wearing the new Jumpman basketball shoes , you might be as good as Micheal Jordan . People do not think that they will be as good as the stars of course , but at least they will be equip just like they are .

To answer this question it is important to see it from different points . On one hand it is good to have a broad knowledge of different academic subjects . For undergraduates its better to have a main idea about different topics to see what they are interested in . Without this knowledge it is impossible to decide which subjects you want to take in the further studies . But not only for the academic career a wide range of knowledge is important . To understand connections between different subjects or to understand social problems it is necessary to have an general idea about several academic points . There is one more point in favour of a broad knowlege I want to mention . If your academic subject you are an expert in , is no longer something which is important to work at , maybe because computers can do all these things instead of human beeings , than you have to watch for a new job in a different field of work .

That has always been my attitude , since the day I started school . In fact my mother , whose profession is teaching , always taught me that the concepts are the most important things for a student . Thus , on the other hand , memoryzing facts , dates and names it 's completely useless because as time passes , they will soon become confused , unclear , oscure data until they will complete disappear from our mind . There is no use of knowing a date / name if you do n't know what it relates to . On the contrary , as you learn , if you focus on the ideas and the concepts , you wo n't ever forget the essence of any topic . Accordingly , in my opinion , only by focusing on the substance of the different topics the students can form themselves with a serious knowledge . Ultimately , I think that it 's really important for students to think about what they study , to identify the underlying problems that are brought along with every topic and to attempt to form their own opinion about them . Only with this attitude , the students will be able to become knowledgeble human beings instead of a group of worthless sheeps that does n't know how to think on its own .",ITA," I definetely agree with the statement ; in my opinion , ideas and concepts are indeed extremely more important for students than mere facts .

"(TEL) I agree with the statement that ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . Successful people always have some rules and regulations and preplans everything , they do in advance and get success by implementing those rules and regulations . They are having very strong determination and will power to get success in their work . Let us consider an example of the great freedom fighter who was well known as Mahathama Gandhi of the country India . He had been successful in implementing the non-violence movement and also bringing awareness among the people about the movement and succeded in gathering the people and bringing in them awareness . He had struggled lot for bringing freedom to the country with the coperation of other leaders . He had all the qualities which had mentioned in the 1paragraph . He was puntual and sincere and hardworker and also the best freedom fighter among all the freedom fighters of India . He had taken a risk in implementing a new movement and succeded in it . In another example , consider a good proffessor . A good proffesor normally make plans evrything he has to teach for students in advance . He will make a proper time table and also how to prepare students for exams and get success in it . He even prepares how to mobilize the students for their future career . During the class sections , he will implement all the palns he had been made before . He will finish the portion in time and prepare students well for exams and also give suggestions to thier career . Finally , I conclude that successful man always preplans everything and follow his rules and regulations . In former example , if Mahathama Gandhi thought that why to take risk then he may not succeed in bringing freedom to the country . In later example also , if a proffessor thinks that why to take risk in giving suggestions to students about their career then he may not be a successful proffessor . So I will say that a successful man always try for new things and take risks rather than doing regular things what he has known .",TEL," I agree with the statement that ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' .

When a student had understand certain concept student can develop more ideas by himself . By understanding it the student will able to answer any type of the question on that topic . For Example let us consider that a student is studying on motor . The student need to understand the main idea and what are the concepts that are related to that topic . And how the motor works and many more things about the motor . But , less importance should be given to learn facts .

(TUR) Many different approaches are used in the education system of an educational community . Mainly ; two types of approaches emerges in a school curricula ; one is practical application of issues which profoundly depends on the understanding of the ideas and concepts ; the other one is undoubtedly the theoretical approach which focuses on the merely comprehending of the facts and details . As far as I am concerned and as being a student for a considerable amount of my life-time ; I am a proponent of the practical approach and think that schools must pay attention to teach ideas and concepts and should provide each student a broad vision to comprehend them throughly . There are a number of important reasons I can settle down about the beneficial points of the practical approach ; meaning ; procuring students with the ideas and concepts . The main advantage that may come along with such an attitude in an education system is the fact that students can learn how various people applied-otherwise saying practiced - the facts . They are not only feeded with raw material ; but ; also application of the facts ; their processed form is also given to them . During a school life ; a student may not value the importance of the facts learned . And ; this was what exactly happenned to me and my classmates in the philosophy class in the lycee . I have always considered that class as a base one to understand the very basics of science as it teaches to think in both quantitative manner and also abstract way . But ; I have graduated from lycee being devoid of having the abilities in pholosophic thinking . Because ; our teacher would talk about the facts all the time . For example ; when she talked about the evolution of the world and the facts related to it ; she never touched to the various ideas proposed by celebrated philosophers such as Sokrates and Platon . As a virtue of our teacher `` s educational approach ; we learned to memorize the facts ; furthermore denied acceptance on thinking on further ideas or concepts . To sum up and to cut the story short ; it is much more important and further beneficial to make students learn the ideas and concepts which are the application of various facts solely or in combination with other facts .

But trying to find new things and curiostiy are not enough for success . You should also make a good plan and hardworking on it . Finally risktaking .

"(TUR) I think being youmg means to be able to do things more easily and freely . When you are young , you are less responsible and you have more energy and the feeling of excitement for life . Hence , I do agree with the statement saying that ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ' To illustrate my opinion we can compare some family members . The parents are responsible for both their lives and their children 's lives . So , they can not move free from their children . For example they can not go to holidays without considering their children . They should find a solution about their youngs . Also , they should take permission from their work . On the other hand , children can easily go to holidays by just taking their parents ' permission , although sometimes they even do not do this . They are more free to do the things they want to . If we think about the couples just married , the situation is not too different again . Once you begin to work . you become a member of real life dealing with real problems to survive and you forget about the beautiful parts of living . You are so surrounded with the problems that you become having a monotone life full of problems . However , when you are young , you do not have to earn money to survive . Your family supports you financially . Youngs also have responsibilities like finishing school , but they have more free time compared to older people .

It makes no sense to learn facts only be heart without understanding the real content and sense . When you simply learn something without really understanding it , you are likely to forget everything soon . After a few weeks , you will not be able to memorize what you have learned anymore . But when you really understand the idea and the concept , you will probably remember it much longer or even a life long . I experienced that phenomenon myself . It is now nearly one year ago that I passed my `` Abitur '' . And I have to submit that I forgot a lot ... Things I learned by heart for instance in biology have disappeared nearly completely . But on the other hand , I can remember almost everything in maths . That 's because I really understood the concept behind all these maths operations .

Rather than driving cars by themselves , people would take bus or Mass Rapid Transit System to their destination for it is more convenient . Take my home city Taipei for example . Instead of being caught in the traffic jam during rush hours , people in Taipei prefer taking Mass Rapid Transit System to commute . I think this will be a trend in the future . In addition , the further aregument to strenghten my position is that not using cars is an effective and efficient way to save energy and reducing pollution . For fear of depleting the prcious energy in the globe , it is wiser to do our best to save energy . Moreover , to maintain a good and suitable environment , reducing both air and noise pollution by not using cars is a good method .

Finally , another reason to reinforce my view is that taking public transportation system is much more economical than driving cars , Actually , maintaining a car is quite expensive .

"(ARA) I agree , I belive in a saying that states `` High risk equals high returns '' . From eralier courses i have taken in school i learned that one should place their eggs in different baskets , which means that investments should be invested in different new ideas instead of concentrating on one sort of new business or idea . One can never grow and develope if they keep on preforming what they already know how to do well , inorder for somone to grow and develope they must try new things , take chances , and make mistakes . For example , when a baby first learns how to crawl and becomes very good at it , the baby is never gana crawl for the rest of his life so the baby will take the risk of walking , even tough the baby will fall several times , the baby will try again and again that 's where not being afraid to make mistakes comes in . The baby cannot run unless it can walk , this point emphasises the imnportance of taking risks to achive great success . There are a lot of examples one can speak about , for example . For example , Bill Gates a well recognized business man in the United States started off with a business idea in college , and instead of continuing his studies he took his idea and put it into action , he now is the owner of an internationally recognized computer software company Microsoft . Microsoft is always taking risks and introducing new ideas and trying new things in the market causing Microsoft to still grow and strive in the market . Trying new things is never a risk I belive , how can somone have potentail to grow and strive in todays economy if one is not willing to take initative and try new things . Failling should never hold someone back from succeding in something but it should be a lesson to learn from to do well next time one tries again .",ARA," I agree , I belive in a saying that states `` High risk equals high returns '' .

For example , when a baby first learns how to crawl and becomes very good at it , the baby is never gana crawl for the rest of his life so the baby will take the risk of walking , even tough the baby will fall several times , the baby will try again and again that 's where not being afraid to make mistakes comes in . The baby cannot run unless it can walk , this point emphasises the imnportance of taking risks to achive great success . There are a lot of examples one can speak about , for example . For example , Bill Gates a well recognized business man in the United States started off with a business idea in college , and instead of continuing his studies he took his idea and put it into action , he now is the owner of an internationally recognized computer software company Microsoft . Microsoft is always taking risks and introducing new ideas and trying new things in the market causing Microsoft to still grow and strive in the market . Trying new things is never a risk I belive , how can somone have potentail to grow and strive in todays economy if one is not willing to take initative and try new things . Failling should never hold someone back from succeding in something but it should be a lesson to learn from to do well next time one tries again .",ARA+TUR
"(SPA) People in general tend to do either one of these : enjoy or not enjoy life . It doesnt matter if the person is young or old , enjoying life is a matter of personal decision . Comparing who enjoys life more , old people or young people , is a matter of opinion , because they ca n't be comparable . Comparing a young life with an old one is like comparing green grapes and purple greapes , eventhough they are from the same species , their taste is totally different . Young people enjoy activities that old people do n't enjoy anymore and viceversa , a young person wont enjoy some activties as much as an old person will , eventhough they are both human . Old people tend to enjoy life in different ways . Some of the activities that are common for old people to do and enjoy include reading , listening to music , eating , sharing time with the family , learing , watching T.V etc . There are some activities that old people are not able to accomplish anymore , but they enjoy to watch it . The man next door , Carlos , used to play soccer . Now he is too old to play soccer but still he enjoys watching it , and believe it or not , he screams to the TV and cries if his team loses . Carlos , as many other old men , enjoy more watching the soccer than playing it because his physical habilities are now limited by his age . Many young people belive that old people cant enjoy their lives because they cant do certain activities that they do and enjoy . This is an erroeus thought . Old people enjoy their life just as young people enjoy thiers . That someone young likes more to play soccer than to watch it doesnt mean that watching soccer should be boring . Old people , like my grandfather , love to tell stories and bring back memories of things he did when he was young . He likes to go through his life and tell us , the grandchildren , about it . Eventhough he cant do those activities or trips anymore , he still enjoys to share them . Young people enjoy their life just as old people enjoy thiers , but again , differently . Someone around 17 years old might enjoy going to parties , dancing , playing sports and hanging out with friends . While someone about 70 years old wouldnt enjoy that at all . Martha , a friend of mine , used to enjoy going to parties , hang ingout and dancing . Today she is 65 years old , and she doesnt enjoy that anymore because she gets tired and she usually believes that the music volume is too high . She now enjoys cooking , talking and reading . A young person can not judge who enjoys life more because they havent lived that old to comment on that . They dont know the perspective of an old person because they havent been there yet . Meanwhile , old people are more likley to know by their personal experiences wheather they enjoyed life more as a young person or as an old one and it is all matter of opinion . Enjoying life is a matter of decision . One might decide to live a happy life while others might decide not to . It doesnt matter if one is young or old , enjoying life is a matter of personal decision . Old people and young people , both can enjoy life to the same level only that by doing certain things that one , either the old or the young , might think that is not something he or she would enjoy .

To my mind , I think that students must understand ideas and concepts ( absolutely ) because it 's a way for them to mature , and also learn facts . On the one hand , when they understand ideas they can afford exposing their opinions . The best solution to it is to attend school because it 's a good way to attend different types of class and to understand different things from each one . The fact of speaking with students can make one 's view . Going to school allow you to ask questions to professors if you do n't know something or do n't understand something . For example a student who used to believing that Doctor Kelly commited suicide and whose profesor explains him the real causes of his death will be more efficient after because he understands something . On the other hand it 's really important on a student 's life to learn facts . Indeed , the best solution to learn facts is to be confronted by . You can read magazines , watch television , surf on the Internet , in a word to put forward with times .

In Japan , there are diverse colors and it 's very difficult to make these color , thus I want to get it with Japanese color . However , my favorite clothe are different of color . I claimed these materials to shop staff . But they just talked about the photographer is mistook to make the catalogue . When I buy the car , I always look the advertisement which are listed a lot of them . If I felt this car is cool as well as expensive one , I try to buy it . However , it 's totally different from list . Because advertising-maker used the immitation materials when he makes the catalog . In the concludion , many advertising are so different from the genuine thing . We should take care about these truths . Whenever we buy something , we should check it on our foot before buying something via the Internet or telephone order . We had better to hear the oral communication with genuine experienve about the materials .",KOR+CHI+JPN
"(ARA) Being successful is about knowing what you are doing and how you are doing it . But it 's also about taking chances and working hard to seek your ambitions and aspirations . And to do so , people should try new things and take new chances . But at the same time , they should be very careful with their actions and decisions , so that they wo n't regret if anything had happened wrong . First , In order to be successful , people should know exactly what they want and what they are looking for . For example , If a man wants to be successful in his job he needs to be working for something he really likes and he 's really good at . And not doing something just because that was the only opprotunity he got . He should try and find what he is good at and find what he really wants . Having a successful life is about having a happy , fulfilled and satisfying life . Second , People who want to be successful should go and find their own chances instead of just waiting for the chances to come to them . And if they passed through something hard along the way they should try their best to make it through without crumbling . They have to make the best out of everything . Third , successful people have to obtain the knowledge and the wisdom on how to keep their success rising instead of falling . Being successful once does n't mean that someday you wo n't be a failure . A person has to be confident in his work so that he would n't regret his actions later .

(TUR) I can say that aproximately twenty years afrer today there will not be more cars in use than they are in use today . In the technologic world everything started to be more easy . The engineers work in order to make more suitable world for people . And everybody knows that the cars are one of the major reasons for the pollutions . Beside pollution they are serious threat for the traffic crowd . In my opinion after a few decades They will be fewer cars in use . Subways will be established everywhere . It has already been using in most of the places in the world and it will be the easiest transition in the cities . It started to be used more than cars in some of the cities which are very big and very crowded . The people who live in big cities got used to use the subways but in smaller cities there are still many people who have never seen subways before because they are not aware of this easy transporting machine they maintain to love their cars and use them . I believe that when their cities are started to enlarge and when they will get red of the crowds they will want to use someting else which is much easier . Moreover not only the subways but also some other vehicles will be using after a few decades such as bycyles . There will be special roads for the many people will be more happy than they are today because they will be more healtier . They will go to closer places by using them .

"(ITA) Well , I kinda disagree with the statement given because in my opinion you ca n't really understand ideas and concepts if you do n't have a good knowledge about facts , and viceversa . So , I think they both are important for students . For example , if a teacher would clear concepts such as socialism or comunism in an history class , he will of course need to explain and let students understand ideas and concepts of these two important subjects , but he would n't give his students a complete preparation on that without taking consideration of the facts , like the fact that following this ideas and concepts the Russian post Warsaw-pact ( and all its satellite 's countries ' ) economy have fallen because it was n't possible to rule a country with that kind of principles . I am sure that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts , so that they can take their decisions and follow or ignore some of them to finally have their own ideas and concepts to grow their capability to interact and agree or disagree with other people in a wide range of fields . But I would n't say that this is more important than learning facts , because if you have your ideas and concepts but ca n't use them for they do n't fit with reality nor with what history tells us , you will never be able to bring an interesting point of view about any topic given . So a good balanced preparation both in the `` ideas and concepts-area '' and in the `` facts learning-area '' will give the students the best way to take decisions , have their own ideas to fight for , make up their minds ( why not ? ! ) and finally feel free to talk about any subject without feeling ignorant or frustrated because of their lack of knowledge about ideas and concepts or because of a fact itself .",ITA," Well , I kinda disagree with the statement given because in my opinion you ca n't really understand ideas and concepts if you do n't have a good knowledge about facts , and viceversa .

Some people may agree that young peolpe do n't help others , while oyhers tend to state that young people help each others the their communities all the time . However , I have also come to my own opinion that young people do not spend much time on helping their communities . First , as techonolgies improve , too many recreations could deflect the concentration of young kids . For instance , the video games and internet , created in late 1980's , provide much more visual pleasure that before . So more and moer young people would like to spend all their to play games or chat on the net rather than give some time to help their communities . Unlike young kid before , who did have more time to interact with other members in their communities , young people nowadays have less topics of communities , except games , to discuss . So they do n't share their lives with their communities , no mention to help their communities . Second , in my opinion , fewer and fewer young people nowadays do realize the meaning of helping others . It is a pitty that even in the school , teachers rarely instruct the real virtues of human . All the teachers ask young kids to do is that they should forcus on themslves , not others . They just acquire knowlege form textbooks , but they do n't learn how to deal with other people , respect other peoplem , and even help other people . As a result , they do not give any support to their communities , because they do n't how to do and what to do . Thay is not to say , of course , that other points of views are without merit .

I disagree to the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do . I strongly believe that the degree of enjoyment one experiences in life is dependent on various factors , the most important being one 's own mental-set . For example : An old man woud rather be enjoying more , playing with his/her grandson than the grandson him/herself . So , enjoyment is not based on age . It is one 's own mind set & its ability to percieve things positively & appreciate them . In turn it will result in an enjoyable experience . Living life enjoyably is a skill . It has to be learnt , either through experience or through knowledge . The young people assume partying , going out with friends , seeing movie are the great enjoyments that they are experiencing . But they are least exposed to the fact that these are only traces of happinees , just like bubbles on the water surface . There are deeper , intense & more joyful moments in life . The emotional happiness of spending lifetime with a partner is one of the deep enjoyments older people go possess . With age comes maturity & stability to withhold happiness . The experiences of life also provide the much wanted tolerance to older people . This makes them a better knower of life , relationship & how to derive happiness from it .

"(TUR) I strongly agree with the idea that successful people are eager to learn new things and they like taking risks instead of doing what they have known well before . Which three features do you think will certainly bring the success ? Well , I think openness to experience and taking risks make a person wiser , more creative and more motivated which are the most important features . Firstly , trying somethig new always make us gain more knowledge about the world sorrounding us . Everyday we need to learn so many things since the technology develops so fast . Knowing many stuff about plenty of issues will make us wise and successful people at the end . Secondly , we become more and more creative since we activate our brains so much in the learning process . We make many connections about different disciplines and issues in the daily life . The artists and scientists are very good examples of this phenomenon . Lastly , wanting to learn something new and taking risks lead to increased motivation in people . For example , I believe that I would not have such a big motivation if I was not interested in many areas of life . To sum up , in the modern world if we want to be more successful , we need to take risks and develop ourselves by new experiences and knowledge .

"(SPA) Nowadays , in our countries we have a huge numbers of cars running on the highways , and it seems that something needs to happen to avoid this situation that sometimes becomes problematic . In any case , I do not complety agree with the question . Let me explain better , On one hand , we know the importance that the transnational company cars have for the economy . The motor industry is one of the most important industries in the world . So , I suggest that it is impossible to stop the production of the cars , without affecting other fields , or aspects of the economy . And maybe it could have impredecible effects . I am not considering the economy as the most important thing , this is not my aim , but unfortunatelly , we have to think on this fact , because we need to have good economy to avoid conflicts in the future . On the other hand , we have new alternatives to support the impact that the cars have in the planet . In this point , we should speak about cars that use other kind of energy and more or less have the same capacity to move us . These cars use gas , or vegetal oil . We have to assess this point to achieve that the idea of individual freedom remains . In conclusion , in my opinion it is early to know if in the future there will be more or few cars in the planet , because it is not easy to answer this question . Usually the people seem to think just in the negative aspects of the cars , forgetting the possitive points of view . I mean , we have to consider that the car is one important aspect of our common life , and not just for enjoying , but for working or travelling . I try to explain that , apart from considering the numbers of car , we have to know if it will exist the possibility for avoding the damage that the cars do in the enviroment .

I am not considering the economy as the most important thing , this is not my aim , but unfortunatelly , we have to think on this fact , because we need to have good economy to avoid conflicts in the future . On the other hand , we have new alternatives to support the impact that the cars have in the planet . In this point , we should speak about cars that use other kind of energy and more or less have the same capacity to move us . These cars use gas , or vegetal oil . We have to assess this point to achieve that the idea of individual freedom remains . In conclusion , in my opinion it is early to know if in the future there will be more or few cars in the planet , because it is not easy to answer this question . Usually the people seem to think just in the negative aspects of the cars , forgetting the possitive points of view . I mean , we have to consider that the car is one important aspect of our common life , and not just for enjoying , but for working or travelling . I try to explain that , apart from considering the numbers of car , we have to know if it will exist the possibility for avoding the damage that the cars do in the enviroment . I think that the people will create a new kind of car on this goal , for the future . I hope so .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(TUR) I believe those who think there will be fewer cars in the future are wrong for several reasons . It is usually fancy to think that the world will change in radical ways in twenty years , and by radical I mean our great dependence on cars for transportation . For that to happen we must be introduced to newer means of transportation that will be cheap and available and that should provide several advantages such as being faster and not having traffic problem . The only innovation that might help reduce the number of cars is teleporation , that is transfer of matter from one place to another via light waves . However , this is unlikely to take place and catch up in twenty years . Another possible invention that might take up the place of cars might be small airplanes that use highways in the air , but since we will very probably still call these vehicles ` cars ' the total number will not decrease . And as in my previous discussion , the price of these vehicles will be too exorbiant to make they good buys , at least for the average consumer . The only argument that might favor a reduction in the number of cars is the impending scarcity of petroleum and the entailing increase in oil prices . This argument cannot hold because scientists will have invented new energy sources that can replace today 's oil . In fact there is one more possible reason for people 's finally giving up their cars and deciding to walk to their destinations . People , especially those living in big cities , may say that they are fed up with traffic and regret the years they lose in traffic , and thus discontinue driving forever . Come to think of it there is still another possible explanation for fewer car . Maybe people will become very concious and conscientious creatures in the following twenty years and say that they have polluted the environment , stressed themselves out , and harmed their physical healths more than enough . This way they will send their cars to junkyards for recycling and contribute to world economy . Surely enough , each of these assumptions is beyond the reasonable limits of the mind . Therefore , I can safely asume that in twenty years there will be more cars in our streets that there are today .",TUR," I believe those who think there will be fewer cars in the future are wrong for several reasons .

"(GER) The question whether young people enjoy life more than old people cannot be answered absolutely . It varies from person to person . There are , however , several factors that speak in favor of the thesis that this is indeed the case . There is a mental , a physical and a historical aspect to this issue which I want to use to support the thesis that in general life is more fun when you are young . In order to do so , I first want to assume that the difference between old and young is a question of age in years and secondly that the persons to be compared live in similar condidtions ( other things being equal - basically ) , which are not extreme . First the mental part . An important influence on the daily life of a youngster is the fact that he thinks he still has a future . Whether he sees it as something entirely good or bad does not matter , extreme cases excluded , there will always be hope and hope leads to a positive attitude towards life . An old person has a different perspective . He or she will see life more in the retrospective view and will therefore see more often the chancec forgone , excluding the few very lucky people that have always taken the right choices of course . So generally , young people will have a better mindset than older people to enjoy life . The second point is about health . Young people are more healthy as their whole body is in a more dynamic state and better able to heal or develop in the desire direction and to enable them to a broad range of activities . Also the chemical balance in the first 20 or 30 years favour a more intensive spectrum of feelings - although , admittedly , to both sides . The elderly on the other hand have to cope with limitations by their body . We become sick more often as well as our strength decreases . This is an important fact to keep in mind when comparing age and youth . In addition the former and the latter subject are interlinked as the saying `` mens sana in corpore sano '' suggests . Thirdly the historical aspect . In the past the world has changed only slowly and periodically whereas in todays world change becomes an ever increasing and determining factor in daily life . The ability of companies to survive is increasingly determined by the ability to cope with change . And so it is with young and old people that have to live in this world . Young people are able to learn and adapt better than old people whos experience becomes outdated at an ever increasing speed . So the development of the world favours young people more than old people . So mentally , physically and culturally young people have better chances to enjoy life . The most important point to remember , however , is that you are only as old as you feel and that age is not a question of years . There is no rule that you cannot stay young mentally when you are getting older ( at least not to a certain degree ) , that you enjoy your body , having accepted its limits and that you try to keep up with change .

"(HIN) I disagree with the statement `` Young people do not give enough time to helping their communities '' . You can find youngsters doing commuty services at college , at the welfare clubs and anywhere they find themselves needed . College is main area of such service centres .

There were casualties and loss of properties and the poor people who live in coastal regions were badly affected . Our college group , who wanted to help the victims , raised a `` Contribute some and Save them '' event to raise money , and it colleceted a gross amount nearing eighty thousand . It would be small , when only one college is considered , But when all the colleges in that area are considered its a substantial sum .

"(CHI) I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Rather , I would suggest whether people can enjoy life is dependable to their belief and it is not related to their age . Let me define what meaning of enjoy life is . To me , enjoying life means that we should learn from each other , humble otherselves , be interested in relationship . Moreover , we should learn to understand ourselves - our character , reaction , etc and utilize , share and enjoy what we have to one another . Firstly , if we are humbling ourselves , it would make us easily learn from each other because we would not look down upon the others . It could prevent from self-fishness . For example , there are many wars nowadays and most likely , the cause is that we are doing things out of pride ( i.e. , not humbling ourselves ) and we are not thinking from the others ' perspective . With war and conflicts , how can we enjoy life in an easier way ? However , if we learn to humble ourselves , we would know how to express love to each other and we would feel joy to be loved and love another . There would not be so many wars and conflicts such that we would easily enjoy the life . Most importantly , being in a position of being loved is amazing . If you have felt in such a state , you would know that having such a joy in your heart would be called enjoying life . Secondly , if we would learn to understand ourselves and others from time to time , we would feel amazed how we are created in such a wonderful , creative and unique way . For example , you cannot imagine how our eyes can view such a complicated object . i.e. , with reflecting the lights , we would know how dark the object is . We can find not only the appearance but also the character . For example , there are some children who are extremely interested to talk with people while there are some children who are extremely interested in thinking . With learning ourselves and the others , we would easily feel amazed how it could be very complicated and very unique . With searching this kind of knowledge and love , we would also feel joy in our heart that through the joy , we would enjoy our life . Finally , feeling beloved is easily understandable to have joy . How could it be possible if all of us are just willing to be loved ? Hence , it is easily to be confused that loving and share with others would not contribute to joy . Selffishness would be . However , it is not the case . While learning to understand others and humble ourselves , it is so natural to share with others with what we have . For example , if we are keen on hiking , it is so joyful to help others to hike with us through the difficulities . Though it seems that it is difficult , the final achievement through toughship could bring us to have joy with one another . It is just like that a couple could feel very warm when they can share their life with one another .

Every day a new fuel efficeint concept is discovered by mechanist all around the world and sciencetists all around the world are finding new ways to replace petroeum in the automobiles . and with the increasing usage of solar energy in devices , the day is not far that cars would run on solar energy . And then the number of cars on the road will be insreasing dramatically . Nowadays the governments of each and every country are expanding the roadspace ratio in a city or a town primarily due to enhance the traffic movements in and around a city . New cities r being established with broader and smoother roads . These prewailling conditions will allure even those people , who were scared of driving or who hated the road conditions , to have their own personel cars , which will directly shoot up the sales of cars , which are now available in more beautiful and attractive shapes , sizes and functions . These along with many other factors , which are beyond the scope of this essay , willdefinitely serve to the increasing usages of cars in not only the next twenty years . but for all the years to come , untill another cheap and easy to use transportation machine is discovered .",HIN+TEL

"(HIN) In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . Yes , I do agree with this statement . This is the twenty first century , we boast about better living , advanced technology etc . The use of palm tops , cell phones , better vehicles has all become a matter of mere show off rather than its actual use . Lets talk about cars ; well we all want this luxury in life . Nothing can be as exciting as a brand new car , and the number of cars shows how rich you are ! In all this show off and luxuries we tend to forget the enviroment . Its a topic which has brought concerns . Its very obviuos , more the people more the number of cars . People are concerned about the pollution in the environment but equal attention is needed for the non renewable resources like petrol and diesel . As the name suggests non renewable resources are those which will get over in next few years . There are not infinite deposits of petrol , natural gases , oil etc in the environment . There is a danger that these will get used and there will be nothing to substitute it . These are non renewable because it takes millions of years for these resources to be formed ; and these are the resources used for driving vehicles . As said earlier we are more concerned about our luxuries . We have started using vehicles not only for long distances but also for short distances just because we feel lazy . The number of cars and other vehicles has increased exponentially , and its soon that it will come down in the next twenty years . As the petrol and oil deposits gets scarce the number of cars will drop down too . As they say , one thing leads to another . Thus , depleting fuels will cause depleted number of cars . If we all realise this problem as soon as possible we will get good results . Because the more early you know the problem you will be able to solve it before it gets too late . We can satrt walking the nearby distances ; it will not only help save fuel but also be healthy for the individual . Apart from this we can start using renewable sources for our fuel purposes . For example using solar battery operated cars . We can also use public transprt systems to cut down on the fuel shortage .

"(KOR) I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

A statement that should be hung in every company 's marketing and advertising departments , because I think that most of the dvertisments polish up their products . Evidence to that are the policies that some companies in the United states have concerning the `` refundable , no question asked '' policy . For example , the famous department store found all across the U.S called Target operates under this policy , giving its customers a three month time span for returning and getting a refund for a purchased product . Had the product been fairly advertised consumers would be returning less products as they would only purchase a product that they are sure of . I once watched a five minute advertisment on one of the advertising channels concering a certain product for the complexion . In the commercial they showed several before and after pictures of people who claimed to have used this product . It was very clear to me , as it would have been to any computer user , that so much of the picres shown of the after had been altered on the computer .

"(FRE) Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well . Nowadays , people dare to change their ways of acting , their ways of thinking and just throw themselves in something new to them , because they are lucid enough to realize that nothing is free nowadays , and above all bored enough with their dull everyday lives enough to refuse to me doomed to constance and non-evolution . Human beings are made to love dangerous and exciting things , to be curious about anything they never had the chance to experience before , and have hidden abilities or even talents for things they did not know . In my opinion , taking risks is inavoidable in order to succeed . Risks may frighten you and make you feel weak , unconfident with yourself , with what you are doing . But still , they strengthen you , allow you to discover your limits and your gifts . I think that people can absolutely not do anything without being aware of their own limits doing that thing . For instance , last summer while I was in England for a linguistic journey with some of my friends , I saved someone who were drowning in the swimming pool . In the very second I see that little girl going down the water , I knew that was the moment of my life . I could not think or imagine what could have happened if I let her drown . My reaction was so instinctive and natural , I just threw myself in the water , embrassed her little body and lift her up so she can breathe . I would never have imagined before that I was capable of saving a life ! It was a shock for me but above all a great discover , since I commited myself to join a club to learn how to save people in emergency situations . Now , I created my own club , and decided to give myself to helpless persons who needs help in some difficult and brief situations . I took a huge risk in saving the little girl but I succeeded in doing it in I am very proud of myself . I have always been a shy person , not that sociable and I just discovered something that existed in me . I figured out the person I really am or can be and this pushed me to take more and more risks and chances to do as many as possible wonderful things on that world because people do not know how good persons they can be and have to prove what they are able to do for their world .",FRE," Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well . Nowadays , people dare to change their ways of acting , their ways of thinking and just throw themselves in something new to them , because they are lucid enough to realize that nothing is free nowadays , and above all bored enough with their dull everyday lives enough to refuse to me doomed to constance and non-evolution . Human beings are made to love dangerous and exciting things , to be curious about anything they never had the chance to experience before , and have hidden abilities or even talents for things they did not know . In my opinion , taking risks is inavoidable in order to succeed . Risks may frighten you and make you feel weak , unconfident with yourself , with what you are doing . But still , they strengthen you , allow you to discover your limits and your gifts . I think that people can absolutely not do anything without being aware of their own limits doing that thing . For instance , last summer while I was in England for a linguistic journey with some of my friends , I saved someone who were drowning in the swimming pool . In the very second I see that little girl going down the water , I knew that was the moment of my life . I could not think or imagine what could have happened if I let her drown . My reaction was so instinctive and natural , I just threw myself in the water , embrassed her little body and lift her up so she can breathe . I would never have imagined before that I was capable of saving a life ! It was a shock for me but above all a great discover , since I commited myself to join a club to learn how to save people in emergency situations . Now , I created my own club , and decided to give myself to helpless persons who needs help in some difficult and brief situations . I took a huge risk in saving the little girl but I succeeded in doing it in I am very proud of myself . I have always been a shy person , not that sociable and I just discovered something that existed in me . I figured out the person I really am or can be and this pushed me to take more and more risks and chances to do as many as possible wonderful things on that world because people do not know how good persons they can be and have to prove what they are able to do for their world .",FRE+SPA+ITA+GER
"(ITA) I think it is very difficult to say which one is more important . However I agree that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts because those are very useful to develop a critical approch to the world . But I have to say that understand only the concepts have both advantages and disadvantage . On the plus side , like It is written before , understanding deeply the concepts help you to see what is happening in the world with your own mind and to be critic too , so you can say what do you thing is running great and what is not . You can also say your opinion and support the solution for a specific problem that you like more . On the minus side it is also very important to learn fact , because history is based on facts , and only the knowledge of facts can help you to understand what happened and how can you act in order to avoind the bad things . In addition many works are based on the facts , for example an administrator or a manager of a company must decide what is better to do based on what really happened . On the contrary there are other jobs where I think it is more important to understand the concepts . let 's consider an engeneer : he has to develop new products and he has to solve very difficult problem and also he is always looking for the best solution , so he must elaborate new solution based on what he already had learnt .

"(TUR) A person starts to learn from birth to death . The amount of knowledge changes over time during this life perod . Its contents become more spesific and detailed as well .

"(FRE) Advertisements is a important part in selling products and a good advertisements will bring benefits .

However , my personal point of view think that most advertisements make products seem much better than in the reality . Firstly , before going any further , I would like to give an example which comes in my mind , the washing powder on advertisements can fight against everything like ice cream on a jean or fruit juice pour on a tee shirt . Moreover , the washing powder can wash efficiently in a cold water so people can save money . According to me , this example seems exagerate to sell a product . Secondly , some advertisements put the best product in the advertisement but show the price of a low range product . The goal is to show that everybody can afford to have a good brand .

Innovation is always the need of the hour has always been the need of the hour .

He will have to move on the next thingh and try to improvise on that rather then doing only one thingh and try doing the best he can only then he might be succesful . The best in any field have goneup only by exploring , we can take examples from any field be it sports buisness politics journalism . For example let us take the great sporting legend SACHIN TENDULKAR who plays great cricket and is the best batsman of all times but just being that did'nt satisfy him he kept on improving himself by creating new shots of his own being unorthodox in his playing techniques others in the same field stuck only to the basics doing only what there are good at and not innovating themselves or exploring themselves . These pepole are not as successful as SACHIN is . This theorey is not only restricted to sports . It extends to all fields the rags to riches stories of buisness syon DHIRUBHAI AMBANI once a textile czar reinvented himself and took risks and dared to do diferent and went into the petroleum buisness . Today his company is the largest private petroleum company in a major country like india all this would not have been possible if dhirubhai wouldnt have taken the risk of going into petroleum which was new for him despite the fact that he would have comfertably be only in his textile buisness . His company certainly would'nt have been so successful if it were n't for dhirubhais ability to take risks and do new things . He and a majority of successfull pepole owe their sucess to a moderate risk taking attitude and the daring to do new things , which is very true .

He will have to move on the next thingh and try to improvise on that rather then doing only one thingh and try doing the best he can only then he might be succesful . The best in any field have goneup only by exploring , we can take examples from any field be it sports buisness politics journalism . For example let us take the great sporting legend SACHIN TENDULKAR who plays great cricket and is the best batsman of all times but just being that did'nt satisfy him he kept on improving himself by creating new shots of his own being unorthodox in his playing techniques others in the same field stuck only to the basics doing only what there are good at and not innovating themselves or exploring themselves . These pepole are not as successful as SACHIN is . This theorey is not only restricted to sports . It extends to all fields the rags to riches stories of buisness syon DHIRUBHAI AMBANI once a textile czar reinvented himself and took risks and dared to do diferent and went into the petroleum buisness . Today his company is the largest private petroleum company in a major country like india all this would not have been possible if dhirubhai wouldnt have taken the risk of going into petroleum which was new for him despite the fact that he would have comfertably be only in his textile buisness . His company certainly would'nt have been so successful if it were n't for dhirubhais ability to take risks and do new things . He and a majority of successfull pepole owe their sucess to a moderate risk taking attitude and the daring to do new things , which is very true . Thus we can obviously say that the mantra to success is to try new things and take new risks rather then doing only what one is good at",HIN+TEL
"(ITA) This problem is wider than it appears . In fact , it has to do with a very complex reality , in which several aspects convey . Surely , and I strongly believe in this : in future there will be fewer cars than there are today , and I am sure of this for several reasons .

Surely , this problem has to do with other parts of our reality , but it 's evident that energetic problems are on the base of using a car . Another aspect , for which I am sure cars will disappear , can be sumed with one only word : `` pollution '' .

"(HIN) I disagree with the opinion that number of cars in use after 20 years will be less than what it is today . Instead I believe that the number of cars in use will rise and will be much more than what it is today . I have number of reasons to support my opinion . The world population is growing at a high rate . Since population and number of vehicles bear a direct correclation , I expect that with more people , more cars will be bought and used . It may be argued that more population does not automatically mean more buying power . But it should be noted the countries with high population such as India and China are experiencing high economic growth rates . This means that progressively , more and more proportion of population will have better buying power . This in turn means that there would be a bigger and bigger segment that will be able to afford cars and therefore buy cars . The cost of producing cars is also declining . Again with cheaper cars , there will be more people who will be able to afford cars and therefore buy them . Besides with research in identifying cheaper energy alternatives to petrol , the cost of running car is also expected to come down which will further encourage people to buy cars . The government spending on developing road infrastructure will also promote the car sales . Governments tend to spend lesser on public transport as compared to constructing highways . This indirectly promotes car sales as limited and congested public transport drives people to buy their own vehicle . Hence more cars will be used to avoid the inconvinience caused by public transport . Also there are social reasons leading to disintegration of joint families into unitary families . Besides the women that were previously more confined to home are joining the work force and moving out . This means that while previously one family of say 10 people could do with one or two cars , now a family of 5 needs two cars . The continued disintegration and women moving out of home will therefore fuel car sales even further . Besides , as humans get wealthier , they look for more convenient options . It cannot be denied that car provides the flexibility to take you right through to the destination as opposed to public transport such as train and trams where a person needs to walk to a stop or station , board the train or tram , then get down at destination station and again walk to his final destination . With more wealth , people will definitely demand more convenience and hence shift to cars . For all the reasons above , I strongly feel that there would be more and more cars with every passing day . Cars are today most flexible and convenient way to travel . For number of cars to go down , there has be a even more convenient alternative . Since I do not see any such alternative in next 20 or even 50 years , I see more and more cars hitting the road .",HIN," I disagree with the opinion that number of cars in use after 20 years will be less than what it is today .

"(TEL) Some people believe that the best way to travel is to go alone as they can spend time as they want . But I strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . In this discussion I shall present arguments supporting my opinion . There are so many advantages for a guided tour . First and the most important advantage is , a tour guide knows the place better than us . So he/she can take us directly to the popular places that should be visited in that city . This really saves a lot of time , which is an important thing to be considered in a short vacation and also we will not miss any good places if we have a guide . Whereas in the situation where there is no guide , we have to enquire about the places to visit and sometimes we may even get lost in the process of finding the route which results in the wastage of time . Second , as the tour guide knows about that place , he will be able to explain the history of that place . For example , he can explain the reason or story behind the construction of a monument or sculpture . Sometimes they also know about the native stories that were not written in the books . In a tour with out guide , we will surely miss all this information . Finally , travelling in group also helps in many ways like a guided tour . First of all , it is fun to travel with so many people and it gives us a chance to make new friends . Also , the other members in the group will help us when we have a sudden emergency like health problem . In contrast , if we travel alone nobody will be there to take care of us in the new place where everybody is unknown for us .

"(ITA) I certainly agree with the stament . All the famous people or the people who became self made men , tried new things taking their risks . It is very hard being a succesfull people doing only what you already know how to do well .

This is the only way to become an important person in the busisnes 's world . Another reason to support this thesis is on the fact that is quite harder to being a successful man in a busisness field where there is lot of competition . So is much easier , once you have found an idea , to make money in a new field of the busisness world . Because at the beginning you do not have any competitor and you could create a `` monopolio '' that gives you the possibility to earn a lot money .

"(FRE) Successful people want to try new things and take risks , instead of doing what they already know to do well , and this for these two main reasons . The first reason is that it is one of the mankind caracteristics . Since the homo erectus , human beings try new things and take risk to develop themselves . For example , at the beginning the first pre-human lived in trees because it was a safe place . And since they had jumped off their trees , they had discover many useful things and had known an great evolution . They had taken risks , instead of staying on their trees like monkeys , which allowed them to made great discoveries . If the human being is at this level , it is because some of them tried new things and made some breaktroughs . For example Galille , took a lot of risk when he propose his therory of a round earth turning around the sun . And he could have trust the old therory which were saying that the earth was like a plate , but he did it to improve the scientifical knowledge . The second reason , is that successful people are getting bored when they always do the same things , because they seem too easy . So , to have a challenge they try new things to discover new difficulties or feelings which can lead to the progress of the person or of the community . For example , Ellen Mc Arthur knows how to sail on a river or on a lake , but for her there is no challenge doing it . She prefers doing things the had never done before , like doing the round of the earth . This is true for sport in general . Its is the motivation of every athlete to go every time further , to push its own limits .

Firstly , by having diverse knowledge of various academic subjects , I can find out in which subject my talent lies .

In the world , there are succesful peopIe who are succeeding beacause they are not trying new things , but also there are people whpo are succeeding because they did start something new .

This makes the boss of a company think twice about starting a new business while currently having a successful company in progress .

"(ITA) I totally agree with this statement . I 'm really convinced that having a widespread knowledge of many different subjects is better than specializing on just one of them because of several reasons . First of all , since I 'm not sure of where I 'm going to be or what I 'm going to do in the near future I 'd rather prefer to have many choices in front of me , many paths to run instead of focusing on just one way that maybe could even be the wrong one . Acting like this I will get ready and prepared to take any valuable opportunity aroused along my personal scholastic journey . In addition to this , I think that specializing on only one topic would be more boring and annoying than approaching different types of subjects . In spite of opening and studying every day the same books and the same lectures I believe that daily shifts from one subject to another could make your life more appealing , still keeping the chance to drop the courses which do n't match your initial expectations . Finally the most important reason , my personal thirst of knowledge .

Hope to be like this ...",ITA," I totally agree with this statement . I 'm really convinced that having a widespread knowledge of many different subjects is better than specializing on just one of them because of several reasons . First of all , since I 'm not sure of where I 'm going to be or what I 'm going to do in the near future I 'd rather prefer to have many choices in front of me , many paths to run instead of focusing on just one way that maybe could even be the wrong one . Acting like this I will get ready and prepared to take any valuable opportunity aroused along my personal scholastic journey . In addition to this , I think that specializing on only one topic would be more boring and annoying than approaching different types of subjects . In spite of opening and studying every day the same books and the same lectures I believe that daily shifts from one subject to another could make your life more appealing , still keeping the chance to drop the courses which do n't match your initial expectations . Finally the most important reason , my personal thirst of knowledge .

"(GER) Nowadays nearly all of today 's cars depend on petrol , either in form of gasoline or diesel , in order to run . Because worldwide petrol ressources are limited , one could easily assume that in the long run , for example in twenty years , gas will be so expensive that many people can not afford it anymore , thus there will be fewer cars in use in total . But on the other hand gas prices , especially in Europe , nearly doubled within the last five years and nothing happened . Customers are getting angry at polititians and the petrol industry , but commute to work by car nevertheless . Also the industrial demand in transport is steadily increasing due to globalisation . Packages and goods get delivered all over the world and one of the cheapest ways to do that still is by trucks on the road . Furthermore huge new markets for automobiles , like China or India are still on the rise . Concerning the petrol problem there is also hope in technical development such as electric drives for cars and trucks or solar technique . Even though there are still a couple of problems to solve these new techniques may one day , lead to much more economic cars or maybe even total independence of the world 's petrol ressources . That could weaken one of the most powerful arguments not to drive cars with combustion engines : the limited petrol ressources .

Furthermore , learning facts is more impressive about taking interest in the issue . Ideas and concepts make them curious only who are interested in the issue such as Aristotle ' s philosophy . But facts are more general things and can take more interest rather than ideas and concepts . To sum up , I believe learnin facts are more important than understanding ideas and concepts",ARA+TUR
"(HIN) IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING IDEAS AND CONCEPTS TO LEARNING THE FACTS Yes , I do agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more to be stressed upon than learning the facts . The `` ideas '' are ones individual 's . And `` concepts '' are formed on the basis of the depth of research on a topic or a statement . Concepts are the basic and easiest way to approach any diversity of topics . It helps to comprehend the subtle nuances conveyed in the text . Once formed they cannot be shifted into a new frame unless otherwise proved through years of regular study . As an example Newton gave three theories of motion after proved and approved by other scientists also . Einstein thought why an apple falls on the Earth downwards from the top of a tree . He did not accept this as a fact but worked on it and improvised a mathematical approach to it . It was an idea that was hitting his mind and at last he came over with a genuine proof for it . '' Ideas give birth to new inventions '' . It is best said by some body . It is just important that how seriously we study on the topic and how far we prove them to be correct in a more logical way . Learning facts is least important . It is simply getting the things into your heads without giving a thought to it . It is called `` cramming '' . Yes , one must be aware of the facts but reasoning is equally important . One must not learn but abserve them , analyse them and reason them so hat the same previously learnt concep can be applied without any panick . Ideas and concepts are the basis to learning the newer and inventing the newer technologies . Facts can be created as many times as we desire from its basic root . The beautiful boulevard of life is full of new experiences that further forms the learning or a concept .

"(KOR) There are different opinions regarding whether adolescents recent days do n't give enough time in helping their communities . Although it is true that there are a lot of examples of young people shown on television or mentioned on internet that gives a lot of helps to the community they are involved in , in my opinion teenagers do n't have enough time to give any hand to their communities as well as no wills to help the community . In this essay I will briefly give reasons supporting my opinion . Most of all , the adolescents nowadays are all confused and complicated in their communities as to the quickly changing society . What I mean by this is that , although some children may have thoughts to help their communities but that they are not capable as to the lack of time they have . Modern day requires students to spend more time in schools and also to go to institutions for extra work . Even for small young nursery kids and significantly more for the teenagers , their parents want more and more from their children . Some students suffer from masses of work due to school , institutions and sometimes private tutors . They do not have time to give support for their communities . Further more , as to this busy life they have they lose power to help their society . After spending a hard time in school . the institution , a private tutor and finishing their day with neverending home works on their desk , they will be absolutely exausted out by the end of the day . It is obvious for those students to feel less tempted and enthusiased in giving support for their communities . Moreover , young people in modern days are more likely to be selfish than those in the olden days . As I mentioned above their are lots of students who work extremely hard , some who prefer to work hard nd some who are forced to work hard . However in either way the competition among adolescents has increased dramtically . I am not saying that there was no competition at all before , but there were truelly less tension among friends and less silent fights among them . And the changes of this in the society had made the young people more selfish , less understanding , not caring of others in order to survive in this terrifying world , so they have this thinking that helping others will get them down from surviving in the world . In addition , the parents also gave a great impact on adolescents ' personality , characteristics and behaviours . In modern days a significantly increasing number of parents nearly obey their children . They do anything what their child asks and wants , and as to this children are more likely to turn out to be selfish and think that they are the best in the world and that they are not to give any help to other people but to be loved and helped from the others . As to the reasons I mentioned above , it is difficult for young people nowadays to give enough time to help their communities since they lack time and physical strength to support them and also changes in their personality as to the changes of the whole world and their outer effects such as parents .

"(TEL) I hardly remember any incident when some young elder member of my community has offered to help me in any way . The growing globalisation and ever-increasing competetion sees to it that evryone becomes self-celtred and works for one 's own gain , thus significantly reducing any chances of social service or social commitment . I totally agree that the youth today are not sparing sufficient time helping their communities . Increasing competition , decline in the moral and ethical standards , uncontrollable desires , advancement of technology have been depriving today 's youth to even think about helping their communities . If we check out any field , be it academic or non-academic , we see that there is an increasing competetion . So , to survive in the world of competetion and to retain his place in this very tough world , the young man of today is driven to focus on his career aspects and to continuously spend huge amounts of time bettering his prospects for a better future . Moreover , we constantly see a continual decline in the moral and ethical standards in any community . And the people who are more into degraded morals and ethics are the youth . This degradation of moral values leaves them so hollow that they can hardly think about their communities , let alone helping them . This moral degradation can be seen quite predominantly in any part of the world today . Someone rightly said `` Man is driven by desire '' . The `` Desires '' of today 's youth have become so intense and so uncontrollable that they can hardly resist these desires , and moreover they are being driven by the not-so-good desires . Desire to advance positively is always conducive to one 's personality , but desiring for `` illegitimate '' things has been having a lethal effect on the individuals personality .

With newer and newer technologies arriving in this world , the youth are engaging themselves in taking pleasure in these technologies . For example , with newer and newer video games in the markets , the youth are driven to purchase them and spend most of their time playing video games . This culture of playing video games is stealing away so much time that the individual hardly realises it . Moreover , this particular activity is eating up most of the available free time so that an individual can hardly think about helping his community .

However , there is a common thing that those successful people have : successful pople try new things , take risks , and also respect the traditions and the old ways that have been known for a long time . For example , a tennis player cannot start creating a new way of hitting spine serve without knowing how to hit the ball properly .

Therefore , knowing and respecting the traditions and the old ways is the fundemental step for the person to be successful . However , just knowing about the past is not good enough for most cases . Here , I will use an example of a researcher in biology lab .

So , the ability to apply what the person have learned about the traditions and the old ways into new things is the second important element to be successful . Taking risk may be the third element to be successful ; however , it is not the case in some fields . For example , a doctor with a great knowledge and ability to adopt it cannot take risks to cure his/her patients if the doctor 's attempting and taking risks result in a number of patients ' death . However , it is also true that surgents and physicians often take risks in operation room in order to help thier patients .

Taking risk may be the third element to be successful ; however , it is not the case in some fields . For example , a doctor with a great knowledge and ability to adopt it cannot take risks to cure his/her patients if the doctor 's attempting and taking risks result in a number of patients ' death . However , it is also true that surgents and physicians often take risks in operation room in order to help thier patients . Finally , being successful is not neccessary important , and maybe it is not something other people judge if the person is successful or not . As long as the person is satisfied with his/her life and provides a great influences for the world , the person can be considered as `` successful '' .",KOR+CHI+JPN

"(GER) Talking about the future is always a very difficult thing to do . So to decide wheter there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years one has to discuss several aspects that may influence this gesture . Firs step , there is the definition of cars . If cars have to have an engine that uses fossial sources , I am sure that there will be fewer cars in the future , even when talking about such a short point in the future as twenty years . If also other sorts of powering a car are within this definition I will need some more steps . Second step is the aspect of population . Up to now the growing of the world 's population is said to maintain the way it does . If that will still be true in twenty years we will definitely have fewer cars . As an example take Vienna , the city I live in . Roads and cars , and parkings spaces need that much space in the city , that the space for houses and people walking is limited . So if there are more people , I suppose they will need more space , and therefore this space has to be gained by abolishing , or at least deminuating roads . Third step is to think of other sorts of transportation and their progress . Undergrounds are already part of almost all big cities and their positive influence is obvious . If there is no negative trend , thinking of security within public places , caused by sustaining terror threats , this means of transport will have its effect to decrease the number of cars . Trains also may become much more important than they are today . I suppose this since I think of the growing size of the suborbs . More people need more space , which results in longer distances to the working places , which have to be passed by faster . So if technology mangages to control higher speed and can ensure this by a higher security standard , trains will overtake the car 's function for taking people from and to their working place .

When you are interested in a specified topic deeply , it is possible to consider the details carefully .

By doing this , they can rapidly get results and combine them . Secondly , working with specific subjects gives you the chance of developing new scientific groups and working in coordination .

"(GER) The following essay focuses on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . From my point of view there are lot of things that make me feel like agreeing with this statement . For example younger people are usually not that setteled or depending on other persons , which makes you enjoy life more and live freely . In younger years one does n't think that much about the difficulties of life that may appear later on , such as illnesses or financial security problems . Furthermore one usually goes to college or university in younger years where life is most of the time a whole lot of joyful fun anyway , apart from some learning times . So yes , I would say that the circumstances in your younger years make it often more easy to really enjoy life than in older years . But on the other hand I think - and I can only think about it because I am in my younger years at the moment - the older people as well have their very own way of enjoying life . Surely they 'll do it in a different way because it 's not all about parties and having fun , but with a life-experience I am sure one can enjoy life at a different level . Looking back on what offered life for you , everything you 've been already able to enjoy and all the goods and bads you 've gone through I think one can enjoy life as much as young people . Apart from that I can imagine that a lot experience , which you definitley have as an older person , can give a good measure as well concerning what is really worth to enjoy and what is not . So to bring it up to a point I would n't say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . Perhaps both groups enjoy and spend their time in different ways but in total I am sure that both are able to enjoy at a similar level .",GER," The following essay focuses on the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .

Does it really convey the idea that young people enjoy life more than people do ? I believe that with maturity comes experience and a tremendous knowledge which helps individuals navigate their life more easily and have more time for fun and entertainment . We will see how the periods of life , the personality of each of us and our aims drive our enjoyment of life . It is a matter of fact that different periods of life offer different opportunities for enjoyment . A younger person will believe he has his whole life in front of him . Naturally he will feel less concerned about his future and long-term objectives . Usually younger persons have a better health and feel invicible like if they would never die . Taking all these concerns away is probalbly the reason why people who just came of age give the impression of enjoying very much their life . Going through studies , youngers are for the first time facing their first fundamental questions : what do they want to do in their life ? Older people have already gone through these fundamental questions and have their life accomplished , giving them more opportunities to relax and enjoy life . Of course , given the fact that each of us is unique , we indeed have different personalities . Personally I am an anxious person who always think about my future and the next steps in my life . For this reason I sometime have the impression to enjoy less my life when I should like many other have a more cursory attitude towards life . Older people when they reach the third age are concerned about how people will remember them and what they have accomplished in their life .

"(GER) In twenty years the number of cars in use will not have diminished by a large number , I believe that rather the opposite will be true . The number of cars will increase during the next twenty years . Due to population rise and the development of different fuels the number of people able and willing to afford their own car will increase and so will the number of cars in use . In countries like China or India , that have a large rural population without the means to buy a car today , the continuing growth of the population and the fast economic development will lead to more people being able to afford a car in the near future . The prices of cars will go down in comparison to the income and this will lead to more cars being in use . Another reason for my belief that there will be more cars in use twenty years from now is that new fuels are currently under research and will be on the market in less than twenty years . For example the hydrogen powered car is already in use today , though it is not ditributed at large . This development of alternative fuels will restrict the impact of the decrease of the resources like oil and gas has on the automobile industry . That way nobody owning a car today will have to get rig of it because of fuel shortage . These people can just as easily buy a car powered by alternative fuel , when their current car breaks down . The alternative fuels , that are being developed today , are also cleaner and less poisonous to the environment . This means that maybe people not willing to use a car today because of environmental reasons will change their mind and buy a car when the use of a car is no longer a hazard to the environment . These reasons support my belief that the number of cars in use in twenty years will not be lower , but higher , than the number of cars in use today . Population rise , the development of alternative fuels and the rapid economic development in countries with large populations will contribute to an increase in the number of people able and willing to afford their own car and thus to an increase in the number of cars in use .",GER," In twenty years the number of cars in use will not have diminished by a large number , I believe that rather the opposite will be true .

"(CHI) I agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years . Certainly , there are many reasons to discourage people from using and owning cars . The first reason is pollution . Cars burn fossil fuels which give out lots of greenhouse gases and other pollutants . As people become more aware of the environment , more and more people are against the idea of using cars now and in the future . The second reason discouaging the usage of cars is the depletion of resources . The number of years we will be running out of petroleum is calculated and it is shortened again and again due to rising demand . The price of oil skyrockets in recent years , and so does the price of gasoline . SUVs are no longer favoured by the consumers and more and more people gave up driving their cars totally or reduce their usage of cars due to higher oil price . As the number of cars on road increases steadily , road conjestion and parking space have become serious problems in many countries , especially in fast developing countries like China and India . It is quite normal for a driver in Shanghai to take two hours to complete a twenty minutes drive in conjestion . Finding a vacant parking place can take up to half an hour in the central part of Shanghai . Unsurprisingly that many drivers get frustrated and give up private driving . However , solutions to the problems of the current cars have been implemented and some of them are working . Hybrid cars invented by Toyota are selling fast , because the hybrid car saves energy and use less gasoline . But the problem of depletion of oil is not directly addressed here as the electricity needed to charge the hybrid cars is generated mainly using oil .

But one important aspect to this revolution is the traffic congestion it has created . I would like to state an example , I live in a big city and it takes me one hour to reach my college which is just 8 kilometers away from my house . I will have plan out things before hand incase i wish to go to a place somewhere far as it literally takes me years to reach my destination . There has been a significant rise in the awareness about the pollution caused by automobiles . This pollution not only effects the environment but also to living beings . The number of cases of asthma and other lung diseases have risen due to the ever increasing traffic and pollution liberated by vehicles . There are cases of early retardation of child development due to the inhalation of harmful lead components released by the vehicles . In earlier days , cars were a status issue . People who were wealthy only could afford a car . It is no longer so . Although people are able to buy cars but the maintainance of cars is a difficult task in todays 's wrold . It is said that buying a car is easier than maintaining it . Today there is an increasing urge to GO GREEN by reducing the individual contribution to go green . People are reverting to the use of cycles and bikes which use plants as fuel . People are becoming more health consious and hence perfer to walk or jog it up to their destinations .

Another reason is you can get lost without a tour guide , you dont know where to go and sometimes you can even feel lost and tired , and addition to that is more dangerous because you never know what could happen .

As a matter fact , too many people know a lot of things , but they do n't have deep knowledge . Furthermore , without specialized knowledge , one cannot succeed in some field .

"(TUR) Advertisements are the most common and colorful part of our lives in the 21st century . Everyday another selection for a material is made or invented and coming to our TVs or newspaper pages to show us his advantages . people have different ideas about the issue that most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are . Some think that it is right others think that it is a wrong way of thinking . I 'm personally agree with the firt ones . First of all , advertisements make the products seem bigger . Every advertisement is a little circus show to make you believe that ` this one ' is the ` one ' that you have been looking for since your childhood . To make you believe they will try every method , especially do not believe in the size of the product in the television . For example last year a newspaper begin to promote a tape . The tape was the best that I have ever seen , I mean ` the tape of my life ' . I ordered the product and when the box came to my home I was really amazed , however , there was a little problem ; the tape was more little than I saw it in the advertisement . Secondly , most advertisements make the audience believe that the product is cheaper . The life in big cities like my own is very expensive to live . So , I am really careful about spending my money and always looking for the prices of the materials that I will buy and I am always looking for the information on prices in the advertisements . For the 20th birthday of my best friend I promised her to buy the dress that we saw in the magazine together . In the adverstisement it was not looking so expensive . I was thinking like that until I went the store to buy it . It was much more expensive than we read . Lastly , advertisements make the material seem more useful . For instance , a friend of mine who has a kilo problem , began to use a material advertised as a ` losing calorie miracle in 3 months ' , it has been 6 months and she is not looking lose much more than only 1 kilo ... The product seem her much more useful than she experienced . Thus the information told by advertisers is not so accurate and convincable . All in all , adverstising a product is something made to show that it is the best that you 've ever seen .

The concept is the first thing that we should learn , because it is what we keep in mind after a lesson .

We could even go further by saying that very often we start by learning the fact and then we understand the idea which is behind this fact .
