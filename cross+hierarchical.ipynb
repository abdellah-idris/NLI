The first cars started to be used in the beginning of the 20th century and have been used for decades as the most available machine for those who are eager to use it . According to my futuristic view about cars in the following twenty years , there will not be fewer cars in use than there are today , but more . I can certainly argue that the globalization process in the `` Third World countries '' will be a very important factor which will lead to the increse in the number of cars . Secondly , because of the lack of the culture of the usage of alternative mechanisms in transportation , the increase will continue . Thirdly , the non-existence of alternative machines produces which are cheap and effective as cars will be another reason for the increase . Finally , even though all of these three handicaps disappear , the government policies and the interests of car-producing corporations will hinder the achievements in reducing the number of cars in use . Firstly , globalization is a process which cannot be stopped in the near future . There are significant numbers of countries which entered the globalization age in the near past , there fore they do not have the number of cars as many as the number of the cars in the West . therefore , the countries like China , India , the countries of Africa or other countries which are not ndustrialized or are not in the free market system newly possesing that culture of usage if cars , which simply measn that there will be more cars in use in the near future . Secondly , in many of the countries , governments suffer from the lack of the culture of using alternative sources of transportation . modernized countries promote the usage of mass transportation and therefore , people living there are used to be directed to these alternatives . but in the countries like Turkey , people do not have the consciousness of mass transportation , instead every individual tend to buy a car for themselves , which is obviously a factor increasing the number of cars . Thirdly , many of car users do not want to give up using their cars since it is very useful and it provides opprtunities to them of which others do not have . People living in Istanbul would not give up their cars since there is a huge mass of cars on the roads which creates a problem for mass transportation users . when there is a jam on the road , the best possible way to rescue yourself from that will not be using mass transportation and get stuck on the roads with those heavy and slow machine , but instead you will want to use your car . Finally , governments in less industrialized countries do not have policies to cope with traffic problem and they do not promote policies to reduce the number of cars in use . On the other hand , the companies or corporations who produce these cars will not be willing to stop their production since that will destroy their interests . these corporations are always in contact with the governments in which they are established and will try to do everything beneficial to their interests . In conclusion , I believe that there will be more cars in use than today . the conditions of globalization and the certaio\",\n          \"(ITA) I think that today is most important to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . Today for a person is most important to find a job , and to find a job you must have the knowledge that for example a factory requires . If i can do a bit of all but i don-t know the exact thing that i was contacted to do i will never find a job . For me today factories search people with a specialize knowledge in one specific subject because is difficult today to find persons that have an adeguate preparation in only one thing . To be a specialize person you must spend lot of your time studying and travelling around your country ( or across europe ) to increase your ability . but today for me persons that have the like to do this are became lesser . I can see a lot of my friends that have just finished to study , they don-t like to travel to another city to become better in their work , they are huppy to stay near their home . Fortunately they have found a job near their home but other persons unfortunately didn-t find it also in other countries . So to get a job that tey like they have must attend specialized courses and they have must travel a lot to increase their knowledge . So if you want a job and particulary a job as you like and near your family , for me is necessary a specialize knowledge of something , something that you know is required in the part you have studied for .\",\n          \"(SPA) If we take a look around the world , we will realize that the most successful people have always been at the edge of tecnology and have accomplish their goals by taking risks and trying out new things . It is necessary just to read any successful man 's biography to understand what this means . We all need to learn how to do things the best way we can and I think sometimes it can be quite scary to go into an unknown field , because there is a big chance we might fail . But failure is always a possibility and is present through our whole life and we have to learn to deal with it , because if we all stick to what we do and do n't try out new things , then the world would stop growing and developing and we would be inmerse in a place where there is no innovation . For instance , in bussiness , the best way to be successful is to come out with some product that nobody else has , that makes you unique . But most of the time , there is a big chance people wo n't like it . That 's why even if you do marketing studies , there 's always a risk factor that involves making decissions based on what you believe in without knowing the results . And in spite of how difficult it looks , it is necessary to keep going and make it happen , just to see how it turns out to be . In conclusion , the key to success is to innovate and take risks , this is the only way we will be able to build a better world , not only getting money , but also helping society , because in my opinion , success is not only defined by how rich you are , but by how much you have done for the world we live in .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I can certainly argue that the globalization process in the `` Third World countries '' will be a very important factor which will lead to the increse in the number of cars .

Thirdly , the non-existence of alternative machines produces which are cheap and effective as cars will be another reason for the increase . Finally , even though all of these three handicaps disappear , the government policies and the interests of car-producing corporations will hinder the achievements in reducing the number of cars in use . Firstly , globalization is a process which cannot be stopped in the near future . There are significant numbers of countries which entered the globalization age in the near past , there fore they do not have the number of cars as many as the number of the cars in the West . therefore , the countries like China , India , the countries of Africa or other countries which are not ndustrialized or are not in the free market system newly possesing that culture of usage if cars , which simply measn that there will be more cars in use in the near future . Secondly , in many of the countries , governments suffer from the lack of the culture of using alternative sources of transportation . modernized countries promote the usage of mass transportation and therefore , people living there are used to be directed to these alternatives . but in the countries like Turkey , people do not have the consciousness of mass transportation , instead every individual tend to buy a car for themselves , which is obviously a factor increasing the number of cars . Thirdly , many of car users do not want to give up using their cars since it is very useful and it provides opprtunities to them of which others do not have . People living in Istanbul would not give up their cars since there is a huge mass of cars on the roads which creates a problem for mass transportation users . when there is a jam on the road , the best possible way to rescue yourself from that will not be using mass transportation and get stuck on the roads with those heavy and slow machine , but instead you will want to use your car . Finally , governments in less industrialized countries do not have policies to cope with traffic problem and they do not promote policies to reduce the number of cars in use . On the other hand , the companies or corporations who produce these cars will not be willing to stop their production since that will destroy their interests . these corporations are always in contact with the governments in which they are established and will try to do everything beneficial to their interests .

I can certainly argue that the globalization process in the `` Third World countries '' will be a very important factor which will lead to the increse in the number of cars . Secondly , because of the lack of the culture of the usage of alternative mechanisms in transportation , the increase will continue . Thirdly , the non-existence of alternative machines produces which are cheap and effective as cars will be another reason for the increase . Finally , even though all of these three handicaps disappear , the government policies and the interests of car-producing corporations will hinder the achievements in reducing the number of cars in use . Firstly , globalization is a process which cannot be stopped in the near future . There are significant numbers of countries which entered the globalization age in the near past , there fore they do not have the number of cars as many as the number of the cars in the West . therefore , the countries like China , India , the countries of Africa or other countries which are not ndustrialized or are not in the free market system newly possesing that culture of usage if cars , which simply measn that there will be more cars in use in the near future . Secondly , in many of the countries , governments suffer from the lack of the culture of using alternative sources of transportation . modernized countries promote the usage of mass transportation and therefore , people living there are used to be directed to these alternatives . but in the countries like Turkey , people do not have the consciousness of mass transportation , instead every individual tend to buy a car for themselves , which is obviously a factor increasing the number of cars . Thirdly , many of car users do not want to give up using their cars since it is very useful and it provides opprtunities to them of which others do not have . People living in Istanbul would not give up their cars since there is a huge mass of cars on the roads which creates a problem for mass transportation users . when there is a jam on the road , the best possible way to rescue yourself from that will not be using mass transportation and get stuck on the roads with those heavy and slow machine , but instead you will want to use your car . Finally , governments in less industrialized countries do not have policies to cope with traffic problem and they do not promote policies to reduce the number of cars in use . On the other hand , the companies or corporations who produce these cars will not be willing to stop their production since that will destroy their interests . these corporations are always in contact with the governments in which they are established and will try to do everything beneficial to their interests .

In theese countries almost everybody ( between eighteen and sixty years old ) have his own car and the problems concerned with this situation are becoming very high . The increasing of traffic and pollution are two of the more negative results of the excessive use of cars and nowdays there are a lot of purposed to resolve theese problems . Many majors , for example , suggest to close the a part of their cities to the cars and this will be good also in order to preserve the beauty of the city centres ( especially if there are historical and artistical monuments , like in italian cities ) . But this will create the problem of moving from a place to another ( people have to go to work or to school ) so it will be necessary to improove the public transports . In my own experience , I 've seen that , depite of all theese purposed , anything has been done . It 's really difficult to renouce to our habits , expecially if a chang means to live a little harder than before . I 'm not very optimistic abuot the future and I think that the use of cars will increase .\",\n          \"(CHI) Nowadays , students are leading to learn more theories , but have a lack of knowledge of the real facts . In my opinion , i do n't think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts . To prove my opinion , i have three reasons . First of all , we all livein the real world , everyday we see grass , flowers , trees , birds , etc. they are all the creatures , we can touch , smell , and hear . Students should be taught how to admire these real things ( facts ) in our daily life , the ideas and concepts can not help students to learn more about the creatures . Second of all , most of the ideas and concepts are in the book , if students are just studing theses ideas and concepts , than they will lose many chances to be in touch with Nature . In contrast , Nature may help children find more ideas and concepts than in the books throughout the practice in the outside . Last but not the leat , the ideas and concepts are the results from the scientists or the phylogists , they may get these ideas and concepts in wrong ways . According to today 's registrations , many new and correct ideas and concepts are out . But in students ' books , the ideas and concepts do n't be improved , so students may get the wrong information about the facts . Then , at this time , experiment is much more important , let students get correct ideas and concepts by themselves . For example , physics and chemistry can not lust learn the ideas and concepts , students must have a objective configuration of the physical and chemical facts . To sum up , the Nature , the Practice , and the Experiment are the better means for students to get ideas and concepts of the facts . In these ways , they can not only learn the truth in the books , but also learn more about facts throuth the process of getting knowlege .\",\n          \"(JPN) I agree with this statement because I beleive that trying new things and taking risks are more interested than knowing how to do well . In my case , sinec I was ten years old , I have been playing tennis , so I practice tennis every day and sometimes compete on the tennis . When I play on the match , I try to play new thing which is so fantastic for me , and usually , when I try newthings , I can win the tounament . in similar to succesuful people , trying new things and tasking risks are connected to successful things : sports players and successful businessmem . Successful sports players are always trying new things and take risks . For example , Roger Federer , who is tennis champion in the champion . He always enjoys the mathc as well as try new things , which have high risk . However , he is not afraid of takiing risks , and he hits the ball to the opponent '' weak point . He takes energey from trying new newthings and taking risks , so he would be tennis champion in th world . Therfore , I believe that similar to him , sports palyers show that taking risks and trying new things is neccessary key . In addition to successful sport players , successful businessmen or women are apt to try new things and take risks , but sometimes , they think that taking risks and trying new things have dangerous , but we can make a lot of money and fame . Also , in today 's society , which is democracy as well as competiotion society , so they always demand winning . I beleive that trying new things and taking risks is concerned with successful people .

The increasing of traffic and pollution are two of the more negative results of the excessive use of cars and nowdays there are a lot of purposed to resolve theese problems . Many majors , for example , suggest to close the a part of their cities to the cars and this will be good also in order to preserve the beauty of the city centres ( especially if there are historical and artistical monuments , like in italian cities ) . But this will create the problem of moving from a place to another ( people have to go to work or to school ) so it will be necessary to improove the public transports . In my own experience , I 've seen that , depite of all theese purposed , anything has been done . It 's really difficult to renouce to our habits , expecially if a chang means to live a little harder than before . I 'm not very optimistic abuot the future and I think that the use of cars will increase .\",\n          \" Nowadays , students are leading to learn more theories , but have a lack of knowledge of the real facts . In my opinion , i do n't think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts . To prove my opinion , i have three reasons . First of all , we all livein the real world , everyday we see grass , flowers , trees , birds , etc. they are all the creatures , we can touch , smell , and hear . Students should be taught how to admire these real things ( facts ) in our daily life , the ideas and concepts can not help students to learn more about the creatures . Second of all , most of the ideas and concepts are in the book , if students are just studing theses ideas and concepts , than they will lose many chances to be in touch with Nature . In contrast , Nature may help children find more ideas and concepts than in the books throughout the practice in the outside . Last but not the leat , the ideas and concepts are the results from the scientists or the phylogists , they may get these ideas and concepts in wrong ways . According to today 's registrations , many new and correct ideas and concepts are out . But in students ' books , the ideas and concepts do n't be improved , so students may get the wrong information about the facts . Then , at this time , experiment is much more important , let students get correct ideas and concepts by themselves . For example , physics and chemistry can not lust learn the ideas and concepts , students must have a objective configuration of the physical and chemical facts . To sum up , the Nature , the Practice , and the Experiment are the better means for students to get ideas and concepts of the facts . In these ways , they can not only learn the truth in the books , but also learn more about facts throuth the process of getting knowlege .\",\n          \" I agree with this statement because I beleive that trying new things and taking risks are more interested than knowing how to do well . In my case , sinec I was ten years old , I have been playing tennis , so I practice tennis every day and sometimes compete on the tennis . When I play on the match , I try to play new thing which is so fantastic for me , and usually , when I try newthings , I can win the tounament . in similar to succesuful people , trying new things and tasking risks are connected to successful things : sports players and successful businessmem . Successful sports players are always trying new things and take risks . For example , Roger Federer , who is tennis champion in the champion . He always enjoys the mathc as well as try new things , which have high risk . However , he is not afraid of takiing risks , and he hits the ball to the opponent '' weak point . He takes energey from trying new newthings and taking risks , so he would be tennis champion in th world . Therfore , I believe that similar to him , sports palyers show that taking risks and trying new things is neccessary key . In addition to successful sport players , successful businessmen or women are apt to try new things and take risks , but sometimes , they think that taking risks and trying new things have dangerous , but we can make a lot of money and fame . Also , in today 's society , which is democracy as well as competiotion society , so they always demand winning . I beleive that trying new things and taking risks is concerned with successful people . In fact , sports players and businessmen or women show that .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"group\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"FRE+SPA+ITA+GER\",\n          \"KOR+CHI+JPN\",\n          \"ARA+TUR\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I was lucky to have personally attended schools that agreed and disagreed with the statement since I attended an italian high school ( that relies mostly on ideas and concepts ) and a canadian high school ( that focuses more on real facts that occured ) . This is why foreigners find that italians know how to talk about a certain topic but they do not know how to actually solve ( or i should say ) `` fix '' it . My uncle , an engineer who lives in Canada , once attended a conference here in Italy and he noticed how Italians honestly might know more about the theory ( in this case physics or maths ) but need help from the more `` hands-on '' engineers from abroad who considered real cases during their education giving them a higher experience . In my opinion learning about facts is definately more enjoyable and gains a higher interests within the students . It also gives you a better insight of today 's world situation . The reason why we study History is because we ought to learn about events that occured in the past and to prevent the same mistakes or find a better solution . Once I came back from my school year abroad it was n't easy for me to get used to the old and stricter method . I tried to make my teacher understand and realize how a fact that occured implicitely has the concept in it . Experience also plays a key role and to discuss about real facts certainly helps a lot . As once Oscar Wilde said `` Experience is the name we give to our mistakes '' . This is why I believe that it is definately important to learn and understand ideas and concepts but the next fundamental step would be to consider a real fact that concerns it . Italy has a very ancient background on its shoulders and it would be very hard to change its attitude or point of view .\",\n          \"(HIN) The issue at hand is , whether it is good to travel alone without a tour guide or in a group that is led by a tour guide . This issue is very troubling to me because there are so many people in the world who enjoy going to different places by themselves without a tour guide although they can afford one . But i 'll support the tour with a guide with a group of people because sometime you can find many good life long friends in a group and many beautiful sceneries that you cannot see without the help of a tour guide . I prefer the best way is to travel in a group led by a tour guide because a tour guide can give you a lot of information about the places you are going to view . You cannot find that information if you are travelling alone without a guide . Moreover , if you are travelling in a group you will actually enjoy the travelling & you would not even know about the time that you spent for travelling . On the other hand , if you are travelling alone without a tour give you can cause trouble for youself sometimes . For example , you cannot find all the sight sceneries without a tour guide & it will be a great hassle if you are travelling alone in a taxi without knowing anything about the city you are visiting . Second reason why a grop travelling with a guide is preferrable because of the economic figures . For example , suppose you are travelling alone without a guide it will cause you to spend a lot of money if you do n't know the visiting city well . On the other hand , in a group tour all the participants pool money so that every individual has to pay a little amout of money . Furthermore , travelling by a group of people can enjoy their travelling a lot instead of a single individual . In conclusion , i 'll say that travelling in a group is far more exciting experience as compared to travelling alone withot a guide . I believe this is better option because it is economic , exciting , worth spending money to travel with a bunch of people rather than alone .\",\n          \"(KOR) In this ambivalent society , the issue whether there will be fewer numeber of vehicles on the land in the future or not is often raised and debated . A portion of society believes that there will be much more cars in our lives , since the opportunity of delivering goods increases as time goes by ; however , I have a differing idea . In twenty years , the number of cars will decrease because the society encounters environmental and social changes : the Greenhouse Effect , and Globalization . One example of a trigger that makes the number of cars reduce can be seen in the responses to the Greenhouse Effect . As society grows , environmental issues are raised , especailly the Greenhouse Effect . This Effect , caused by damaging gases emitted from cars , harms ecological order by influencing sea level to rise . Furthermore , unexpectedly changing climates threatens human live directly : Tsunami in Indonesia . Therefore , people begin to invent alternative vehicles that does not make harmful gases , such as hybrid vehicles . In addition , the increasing uses of bikes encourage people to avoid air pollution . Thus , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in our lives to protect our surronding safe and clean . Not only do the current events furnish an endless array of examples encapsulating the claim that the number of cars on land will be reduced in the future , but social trend does as well ; a prime example is Globalization . As the whole world become a one town , the opportunity to trade and travel among foreign countries has been expanding . As a result , rather than cars that are limited in only one continent , airplanes will attract more people in the future . For example , according to the research in Korea , about 85 % of the nation prefers airplanes as transportation . Also , as most companies , such as Samsung , LG , and Sony , expands their markets toward other countries , the importance of taking airplanes , instead of driving cars in domestic markets , are percieved by many nations . In the paragraphs above , I have shown that in twenty years , there will be much fewer cars in our live , but much more alternative vehicles that prevent environment and help to adopt international trend , Globalization . So , I call the readers to make technological progress in innovating our limited transportation to prepare comming future society .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"country_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SPA\",\n          \"GER\",\n          \"FRE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8800,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" This statement has been greatly discussed in many didactic environments for the simple reason that some consider the theoretical knowledge to be more important than the practical one and some consider the opposite . I was lucky to have personally attended schools that agreed and disagreed with the statement since I attended an italian high school ( that relies mostly on ideas and concepts ) and a canadian high school ( that focuses more on real facts that occured ) . This is why foreigners find that italians know how to talk about a certain topic but they do not know how to actually solve ( or i should say ) `` fix '' it . My uncle , an engineer who lives in Canada , once attended a conference here in Italy and he noticed how Italians honestly might know more about the theory ( in this case physics or maths ) but need help from the more `` hands-on '' engineers from abroad who considered real cases during their education giving them a higher experience . In my opinion learning about facts is definately more enjoyable and gains a higher interests within the students . It also gives you a better insight of today 's world situation . The reason why we study History is because we ought to learn about events that occured in the past and to prevent the same mistakes or find a better solution . Once I came back from my school year abroad it was n't easy for me to get used to the old and stricter method . I tried to make my teacher understand and realize how a fact that occured implicitely has the concept in it . Experience also plays a key role and to discuss about real facts certainly helps a lot . As once Oscar Wilde said `` Experience is the name we give to our mistakes '' . This is why I believe that it is definately important to learn and understand ideas and concepts but the next fundamental step would be to consider a real fact that concerns it . Italy has a very ancient background on its shoulders and it would be very hard to change its attitude or point of view .\",\n          \" The issue at hand is , whether it is good to travel alone without a tour guide or in a group that is led by a tour guide .

This is why foreigners find that italians know how to talk about a certain topic but they do not know how to actually solve ( or i should say ) `` fix '' it . My uncle , an engineer who lives in Canada , once attended a conference here in Italy and he noticed how Italians honestly might know more about the theory ( in this case physics or maths ) but need help from the more `` hands-on '' engineers from abroad who considered real cases during their education giving them a higher experience . In my opinion learning about facts is definately more enjoyable and gains a higher interests within the students . It also gives you a better insight of today 's world situation .

Once I came back from my school year abroad it was n't easy for me to get used to the old and stricter method . I tried to make my teacher understand and realize how a fact that occured implicitely has the concept in it . Experience also plays a key role and to discuss about real facts certainly helps a lot . As once Oscar Wilde said `` Experience is the name we give to our mistakes '' . This is why I believe that it is definately important to learn and understand ideas and concepts but the next fundamental step would be to consider a real fact that concerns it .

This issue is very troubling to me because there are so many people in the world who enjoy going to different places by themselves without a tour guide although they can afford one . But i 'll support the tour with a guide with a group of people because sometime you can find many good life long friends in a group and many beautiful sceneries that you cannot see without the help of a tour guide . I prefer the best way is to travel in a group led by a tour guide because a tour guide can give you a lot of information about the places you are going to view . You cannot find that information if you are travelling alone without a guide . Moreover , if you are travelling in a group you will actually enjoy the travelling & you would not even know about the time that you spent for travelling . On the other hand , if you are travelling alone without a tour give you can cause trouble for youself sometimes . For example , you cannot find all the sight sceneries without a tour guide & it will be a great hassle if you are travelling alone in a taxi without knowing anything about the city you are visiting . Second reason why a grop travelling with a guide is preferrable because of the economic figures . For example , suppose you are travelling alone without a guide it will cause you to spend a lot of money if you do n't know the visiting city well . On the other hand , in a group tour all the participants pool money so that every individual has to pay a little amout of money . Furthermore , travelling by a group of people can enjoy their travelling a lot instead of a single individual . In conclusion , i 'll say that travelling in a group is far more exciting experience as compared to travelling alone withot a guide . I believe this is better option because it is economic , exciting , worth spending money to travel with a bunch of people rather than alone .\",\n          \"(KOR) In this ambivalent society , the issue whether there will be fewer numeber of vehicles on the land in the future or not is often raised and debated .

In twenty years , the number of cars will decrease because the society encounters environmental and social changes : the Greenhouse Effect , and Globalization . One example of a trigger that makes the number of cars reduce can be seen in the responses to the Greenhouse Effect .

In addition , the increasing uses of bikes encourage people to avoid air pollution . Thus , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in our lives to protect our surronding safe and clean . Not only do the current events furnish an endless array of examples encapsulating the claim that the number of cars on land will be reduced in the future , but social trend does as well ; a prime example is Globalization .
